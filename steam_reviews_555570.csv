user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME. [/b] To anyone contemplating on playing this game ask yourself these 3 questions before installing this garbage. Can you stand getting disconnected, crashed, or straight up getting f ú c k e d in the a s s? If you answered yes to all those, then go ahead and click ""play game""."
user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"

i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.

You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."

skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game,

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.

Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for.

user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!

user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )

Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn.

user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."

user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.

Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.

[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun.

user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.

user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze.

user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Insta... You know what? Screw this.

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game

user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny

[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map.

user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer.

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out.

user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for.

Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."

Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"

i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.

You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."

skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game,

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.

Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for.

user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!

user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )

Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn.

user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."

user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.

Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.

[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun.

user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.

user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze.

user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Insta... You know what? Screw this.

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game

user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny

[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map.

user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer.

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out.

user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for.

Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."

Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"

i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.

You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."

skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game,

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.

Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for.

user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!

user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )

Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn.

user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."

user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.

Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.

[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun.

user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.

user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze.

user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Insta... You know what? Screw this.

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game

user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny

[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map.

user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer.

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out.

user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for.

Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."

Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"

i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.

You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."

skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons.

user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game.

user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game,

user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.

Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for.

user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!

user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )

Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn.

user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."

user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"

user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights.

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.

Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.

[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.

user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....
"
user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun.

user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"

user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."
user_76561197995823838,"Less hackers but I farmed so hard to get a viechel and got instant discconnect while driving. Annd reconnect to the server is glitched. freaking ask me for password to recon, got so pissed had to delete the game ;C

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]

    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]

    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate

I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

music is as gay as it could be"
user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
user_76561198358378223,"Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:

*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful
*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused
*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused
*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused
*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.
*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.
*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.
*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.
*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.
*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.
*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle
*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.
*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all."
user_76561198059679523,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.


This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.

You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.


I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.


It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked. That's what this game is.
"
user_76561198165114946,"GAME CONTROLLING:  GOOD AND PLAYABLE - its the only positive feature i found in this game. the maps are horrible borring, the zombies are to kill with a toothpick because they are so stupid and bug around like mad. 

- the map is huge but deadly boring. lets count the trees.

- is this even a multiplayer game? i've never meet some other person.

- walked around in full gear, killed stupid zombies with katana, meet nobody, started counting trees, deinstalled.

"
user_76561198071237562,"Don't listen to bullshit reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.
1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game
2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about
3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.

You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.

Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. 

Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. 

Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.

In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.

The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. 

That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.

PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.


All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."
user_76561198116477585,"Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell. Freezes every 5-30 minutes, never was able to play more than 30 straight minutes. When it freezes, your character stays active, so you die. Every. Single. Time.

The community... is terrible. Go on newb servers and everyone ust gangs up on you, camps weapon spots, or camp spawn points.

Then the guns... wait what? More guns than zombies? Okay then...."
user_76561198052105300,"I lost all my loot due to a game crash which f ú c k i n g happens [b] ALL THE TIME.

user_76561198089138606,Game is just like it was 7 years ago. Unfinished and fiilled with bugs. Complete waste of time and has a steady stream of decreasing players. That being said I'm part of the people leaving this game.
user_76561197991066336,"New devs but taking the same approach as old devs.  NA servers are in Eastern Canda leaving anyone in Central and West coast US at a disadvantage(even some people in EU have better ping). Also these servers are very low quality and are laggy 90% of the time making the matter even worse.  Now setting that aside the community is one of the most toxic ones out there that abuse every glitch and mechanic whenever possible to win fights. 


This review sums it up in detail: http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieKnR/recommended/555570/

Edit:  Feel same after many updates."
user_76561198092330595,"Now before i start ... I know this game is for free but even free games have to be playable.
THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE , you crash every half an hour sometimes even more even with just 15 ppl in the server. (My PC is pretty new and not the worst on the market , remind you)
The enviroment is made so badly that you get stuck into everything , the bushes that you could hide in , which are your last chance of survival ? NOPE , you have to fully walk around it because its a solid sphere object. 
Full of pay to win.
Survival mode hasnt been opened for months , also the devs are just mone hungry dicks who cant make a decent game without having to rename it on steam 3 times so it doesnt have negative reviews.
In the middle of a chase after a bandit through a city , have been tailing him for 30 mins. Finally cornered him! *Freeze , game has stopped working* , Login ... Died by zombie while was crashing.... DELETE GAME"
user_76561198015999265,"Poorly designed with a lot of bugs. Full loot game that will make you crazy, being disconnected and losing all gear all the time. Random disconnects during PvP are typical. Lags and inventory problems are constant. After disconnect you cant join server as it says that you still play the game. Unable to resurrect even though timer gone to 0 will make a lot of ppl crazy clicking revive button with no effect. A loop of bugs that can get you occupied for hours tring to figure out how to make this game work till you realize you cant do nothing as its garbage. Its free but is not really an advantage in this situation as ""making you angry for free is not the best deal"". So if they would pay like 50$ to play this then maeby it worth max 2h of your time."
user_76561198357796079,"I defently recommend this game ecause in way its like dayz but easier to get weapons which fits the pupose of the game, tjere are clan wars and finding weapons is pretty comon so it does not matter if you die in a battle its easy to get more weapons. Now the only tjing that I dont like ia the graphics they could be improved massivaly. Bit overall for a pvp game I tjink it has the right ammumt of depth put into it."
user_76561198042823703,I really wanted to like this game. I honestly did. but it's really fucking hard to like it if every single sever disconnects me before I can even enter the damn game. I literally sat here for an hour trying to connect to multiple servers and not one would let me on. Absolutely pathetic.
user_76561198016123471,"Its honestly not that bad, Easy to get money, fun shooting, weapon customization. Even got Battle Royale. Only cons for me is that the zombies are WAY to easy"
user_76561198017162549,"Nope. 1st spawn in on beginner server: shot by a PK with an AK within two minutes. I did not get a hit on him with my flashlight. Second spawn: got dark quickly, managed to find a few abandoned cars anda few not-so-valuable items before the second zombie ate me. 

Pros: looks like a good game
Cons: It isn't."
user_76561198351011122,"T O T A L S C O R E : 4/10


First of all I would like to say that unlike the majority of the reviews I actually went very indepth into the review process of this game and heres how the punches land....

graphics: 5/10 
I can very honestly say the games gfx are very bad.

Even if you have a high end pc expect low fps / fps lag.

The real problem here is it shouldn't take up as much cpu power,  for some users streaming the game for gameplay streams is a nightmare.

Some bugs are really glitchy!! Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)

Sounds: 8/10 
The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns, 

also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)

Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)

Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene, 
1.join a very low populated server
2.loot and kill zombies 
3????
4profit?

My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumble 

upon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.

All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:
1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATING
 You cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.

2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group Cheaters 
Group Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.
Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.

3. In Game Bugs/ Items/ SHIT THAT HAS TO GO....
Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get fuckin rid of them? SEE ABOVE
 
The anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do.....

user_76561198129672031,Server always has crash and disconnect problem. Rent a server but can't even play more than a minute because of the disconection problem.
user_76561198215702616,"Played this a lot and here's my conclusion. Don't play it. It's shit.  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.

PVP:
--------
Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.


PVE:
------
Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do shit... And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..

Game modes:
----------
This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.



Game in general:
----------------
Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.


>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<

Major problems:
-------------------
> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.
> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon
> Riot shields are abused 
> Third person view gives too much advantage 
> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.
> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.
> Too many hackers 
> Game too unstable

CONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lot


FOR DEVS:
If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly. 
> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )  
> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )
> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map. 
> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map
> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."
user_76561198048636206,"reach beginner server time limit after 24 hrs of in game play time which was super fun. Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as fuck by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall. 

The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.

10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."
user_76561198117195938,"This game doesn't give me a chance to play it, because everybody kills the beginners. You should have a co-op mode, instead, where you play as a team. The whold buying stuff system is stupid. You should just collect it from the zombie villages. The zombie villages are too far apart, like the areas, and you have to run through the woods a lot, which takes forever. the zombies should be on the roads and stuff with cars you can drive. You can't drive the abandoned cars in the environments. You have to like buy a jeep which is probably a million whatever game credits or money or something. This game is like being among a bunch of psychopaths who just like to kill each other. That, to me is stupid. there's no doors to open and close.. it's just like... what is this? i get shot as soon as i join. sometimes i join and i'm on top of another person's head and they kill me when i don't even have any equipment, even on a beginning server. can you make it so that you can't kill other players? that would be okay. there's like no chance to even progress beyond a beginning server. this game teaches people how to kill and loot places, in disregard for their environment. what is this for?
"
user_76561198065668519,"One of the worst excuses for a ""Survival Game"" I have ever seen.

Ultra Graphics look like crap

Game has had 4 NAMES: WarZ, Infestation Survivor Stories, Romeo's Aftermath, Infestation: The New Z

Game has P2W aspects EVERYWHERE

Every server is a deathmatch with guns everywhere

You can hear VOIP from well over 500 metres as if it were right next to you

Zombie noises are sub-par

 - If you want a decent free survival game, go play Unturned over this atrocity -"
user_76561198028370849,"Oh yes, my play time should say a lot about this game.

Tried spawning in on the beginning servers... 

Instant bullet to the face.

Waiting 3 minutes of respawn timer bullshit, and tried again...

Low and behold, another instant bullet to the face.

Third time...

Insta... You know what? Screw this. 

Spawn camping on new players on starter sever, glitchy rough game, 
and all around was so bad that I could not play any longer. 

Oh and... this is basically exploits the game. The third person and some of the items are way op.

Never again."
user_76561198066728111,194 hours on New Z Good Survive Fps And Good party sistem i am Lawman i have hear and all i have fun. I play with my brothers mates. and we loot farm make skils op and practice is free to play maybe have some bugs. but its ok. Game still dewelope and always have new improwents
user_76561198077398721,"the game has really shit servers, shit devs, you get disconnected all the time the spawns are fucked, sometimes you will put 30 bullets into someones head and they dont die then turn around and put 4 into yours and you die... but overall the game fun if you can look past those things."
user_76561198356886036,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played, locks up a lot and when it does work is is extreamly slow for the low end graphics that it uses. Will not be playing this game"
user_76561198141852136,"this can suck my left testical if im willing to pay 20 fucking dollars to recieve an airdrop i should be the one getting the loot instead of some old ugly looking cunt wearing a fedora playing on a fucking mac book get to eat 15 headshots and drive away like a wee little bitch

i demand a refund"
user_76561198020763360,"This could hav potential, but.. no. Ain't a game for me.

Why? 

First of all I spawned in a server in the midde of nowhre, got an aura protected, ok, cool, I walk forward, aura wars off.. someone waiting me up (spawnkilling).. kills me.. Create new survivor or wait 2 minutes.

I created a new one and joind another beginner server, I reach a town and just find ammo, vests, helms, no wapons not even a shovl which is easy and common to find in our world. I killed ovr 50 zombies with my bare hands.. just circle around the zombie and  you don't get hit...

The sensivity is horrible, it doesn't feel smooth lik in overwatch or call of duty or an other game. 

And you can go on like this.

What I do like?
The world/map, the sound of the zombies, music, third/first person option, gathering/looting stuff,...

But the gameplay is the worst."
user_76561198080312490,"1. Spawn in, find your friends. (if you have friends special enough to play this game)

2. Walk into a small town and find enough guns to make rambo proud.

3. Now that you are set you and your friends go looking for a fight with all of your dank new gear.

4. You stumble upon a random survivor who immediately tries to end your life with his backpack full of LMG's which he got after 5 minutes of playtime.

5. You easily wipe him out with your obese amount of weaponry you found in that small town and shared bettween your friends.

6. You walk up to his corpse to loot and see a unorganized pile of glowing blue cancer covering his corpse.

7. You notice that dank weapon at the bottom of the pile and after 5 minutes of trying to get yourself in the perfect position to grab it you finally pick it up. 

8. Further down the road, you come across another town where you find a group of players looting together who outnumber your group by afew people.

9. you get the drop on them and start picking them off one by one for their dank loot.

10. After managing to overpower the group and take 80% of them out you feel proud that you have outplayed them and only have to deal with a couple more people.

11. You take a look around to make sure you are not getting flanked.

12. You see a swarm of players WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED THAT WAITED A 2 MINUTE TIMER TO RESPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FROM YOU AND PULLED 30 LMG'S OUT OF THIER MAGICAL STASH OF UNLIMITED WEAPON SAFTEY STORAGE AND ARE GETTING READY TO SWIFTLY CONFISCATE THE PRIVELAGE THAT IS YOUR LIFE FROM YOU! 

13. Your life is taken from you and now it's YOUR TURN to wait the 2 minute timer and come back to ambush them. SO YOU PULL 69 LMG'S OUT FROM YOUR MAGICAL STASH AND SPAWN 100 METRES AWAY FORM THEM!

14. Repeat steps 10 - 13 untill: One of you gives up, You run out of stashed LMG's, your group commits suicide, their group commits suicide or you all commit suicide.

BOTTOM LINE:
Do NOT play this game until you have nothing better to do.  But thats just my OPINION (:"
user_76561197963991937,"I'm not sure how to even put this politely to stay within the guidelines. This game is garbage. The animation is sketchy, the graphics are worse than some games from 2005, the community is completely toxic, and anyone that you encounter will kill you. The zombies are the least of your concerns in this game, because people play this game sitting and waiting for another player to pass by so that they can kill them.  It's a hot stinking, poorly optimized dumpster fire, except I wouldn't even waste my pee to put it out. 
-1000/10"
user_76561198057830627,"You know, if I wanted to play a game that I spawn in on a beginner server and get demolished by someone stacked. I would just play rust. Also, the zombie proximity range is insane. If you're within 50 feet they see you and attack you.  Hmm, sounds like a Wal-Mart version of DayZ and Rust compiled into one shitty game minus the availabilty to go into FIRST PERSON. Oh, and when you get a gun, good luck. You most likely won't have a crosshair. Oh yeah, and did I mention this is a ""Free"" game? LOL that's a joke. As soon as you load the game you're prompted with ton's of guns that you can pay for. So it's virtually a pay to win. Well, I have now finally released my anger upon this game. If you play it, good luck."
user_76561198325150680,I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON . Left the game and then tried to reconnect. it said disconnected and it crashed. Then said . Your are banned for exploiting or cheating.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! un ban me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID NOTHING!!!!!!!
user_76561198165696012,"I don't get why people hate this game.. Its actually pretty fun, and the ingame transactions are not nessecary, as you can survive perfectly fine if you are F2P. It is more of a action shooter, not a survival, as everyone you come across wants to kill you. Game is fun! Great to play with friends for a couple of free hours."
user_76561198289890973,"This game really needs a lot of work, having 5-10 machineguns spawn in a single town is really pathetic and makes PVP and killing for loot much less rewarding, gameplay is more repetitive. Zombies are too easy to kill.

EDIT:
Full to the brim with hackers, glitch/bugs, and exploiters of glitches and bugs. Game is never updated and developers are ridiculously greedy."
user_76561198039015421,i don't know what all the bad reviews are for i've killed tons of players and they killed me. tactics plays a large role in the game not how powerfull your weapon is. listen for foot steps gun shots learn to navigate the areas and you'll be find never run out in the open street. i've enjoyed this game its like arma and h1z1 mix. graphics however could use a update but the gameplay makes up for that.
user_76561198093514617,"For a start the graphics are nice and realistic-ish, smooth gamplay. pvp mostly with the shoot first not giving a fuck after atitude that most players adopt, and just a world full of loot and stuff to kill including up to 100 players perserver. 

that is untill it crashes, disconnects or just dose not load you into the game causing you to go back to the home screen, i must also admit MLG anti hack is an absolute beast, 

good game worth the FREE play!! cant be asked to buy anything coz you could get dropped from anywere and anytime, loseing your gear xD but yh i like it its fun and i jut cant grab enough loot :/ its an addiction now but i love it."
user_76561197972457549,"Spawned in, mouse DPI on lowest and ingame sensitivity all the way down and still did 8 full spins with one flick of my mouse. Took 3 steps while glowing green and got killed by someone with an M249. Figured I would respawn one more time, but upon returning to the menu there was a 2+ minute cooldown before I could respawn that could only be bypassed for real life money. Exited and uninstalled the game,"
user_76561198359444704,"I've played a few hours now and honestly, the game is pretty good! It has a few flaws and needs a couple of things but it's overall enjoyable. If you use Nvidia Experience Panel you're able to enhance the graphics and it looks great. 

Pros:
-Lots of different weapons to chose from (Melee/AssaultRifle/SubMachineGun/LightMachineGun/Grenades and more!)
-Alright commuity, avoid the ***holes that steal your cars though!
-Day/Night Cycle like skyrim
-Food/Water survival system, you must eat and drink or dieee!
-Large Supply of ammo to go with every weapon (A portion of the firearms use the same ammo)
-Oversized map to travel across with different areas to loot and explore
-Zombies aren't overly powerful and aren't able to get you if you stand on firetrucks/boxes/high places
-Overall it has great animations(realoding,running,sprinting,prone) Crouching needs a rework i'd say
-Premium skin boxes for weapons can be found throughout the game(requires purchase otherwise)
-Regular Skin can be found too, they drop a bunch of random skins
-Game is not 100% pay to win, lots of freebies!

Cons
-Doesn't have background music, or nature music to make it immersive
-Client crashes every other hour roughly for me (Max settings)
-No wildlife what so ever, no birds, beavers, bugs, nothing. It's a bit plain personally because of so
-Walking in the game is very slow, and takes forever to get from point a to point b
-Having a car is great, but if you disconnect while in it you lose it and people are able to steal it from you (Had 4 stolen)
-Must use Gas to fuel your car, and toolboxes to repair if it gets damage (By pricks)
-Fps drops every few minutes of playing *Goes from 35 to 5 back to 35 to 5*
-Prices of some of the items/gear in the shop are expensive 
-Making money isn't too fast, requires alot of killing and skin hunting
-Not much character customization or gear (Only about 10 different armors for example)

Overall, i like this game. It needs a bit of work but if you are looking for a zombie game this may be the one for you!"
user_76561198352538386,Realy fun to play like h1z1 but not paided meet new friends and made a group and did a sport of killing ppl
user_76561198214965897,"I love this game,its so much fun! I like how the noobs get killed and salty and writes a bad review. I really think that this is the best free to play game on steam. Guys dont do bad reviews its not the games fault that you suck <3"
user_76561197978203754,"There are many negative reviews for Infestation: The New Z most often with good reason but here's the thing its based on individual opinions and experiences. Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom. 

Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.

If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"
user_76561198144539707,"It's so bad.
i get spawnkilled 9 times out of 10, then i have to wait 2 minutes to respawn or make a new character. I finally found some guns and my game crashes. Thanks, would definetley spend all my money on useless and worthless micro transactions.
Yet i keep coming back"
user_76561198288742066,"After a month of playing this game I can say it's a lot like another game I once played: time-consuming, annoying and just a waste of time.

Spend about a month playing on a private server to collect goodies so you have enough to play on a public server. Join a public server, get shot in the head within a few minutes, wait 3 or so minutes so you can revive your player, respawn close to where you died but your stuff is all gone, die a few minutes later, repeat until you can't take it any longer.

Final step: uninstall."
user_76561198136924954,This is an amazing game that new developers are making better. Last developers didn't help the game out and so starting from new the original game was $20 and New Z is FREE. You have no reason not to try this game out as it cannot be related to any other game. it is its own kind and it will continue to grow as we get updates rolling out all the time.
user_76561198359061614,"no support,full bug erorrs,a lot of critical errors that shut downs game in the most important pvps...sometimes when i join a server and its loading when i have entered to the game i see me already dead from others players because stucks on loading...do you wanna have gamers to this game?...so FIX IT if not then i believe that few months and the game goes down...FIX ALL THE ERROS AND BUGS!
"
user_76561198086264950,"WORST GAME EVER! Heave my warning when i tell you this is the only game where you can shoot somebody in the chest 5 times and in the head once (not killl them) while they instantly place down a 50 pound shield, swallow a medkit instantly and peak out a of a corner to kill you. All within 7 seconds. And also there will always be a crew of 7 people running around with snipers in every server who you can't kill. This game is free, but don't waste your hard drive space. Shields and snipers are the bane of this game and it's stupid. Rest In Shit Infestation."
user_76561198044502888,"I decided to give this game a try and I ended up around 20 minutes walking among trees and grass. I managed to find some building areas just to realize they were crowded with zombies. I couldn't find a weapon anywhere, only food and some armor. And the basic backpack has only a few slots, so I couldn't even pick everything. It was a dreadful and tedious experience. I spent 95% of the time sprinting trying to find a weapon or someone in a full server... I didn't die at all but definitely not the survival experience I was hoping for."
user_76561198125250037,This game is without a doubt the most dissappointing game i have ever played in my entire life. The fact that the developers of this game can confidently release such a badly developed game that disconects every second and that is so undoubtedly glitchy is absolutely appalling. none of these people deserve to call themselves game developers because what you have produced is actual living and breathing cancer. Fix the game or please quit your job.
user_76561198153184756,"I really liked this game until i started running into other players. The ""PVE"" and ""beginner"" servers are only such by name. You still take damage from other players, and just like dayz everyone opens fire on sight. I spend more time in menus, and load screens than actually playing. Good gameplay, but until they put up an actual PVE server its just frustrating."
user_76561197961967703,"So far so good. When I first started I was killed twice (very very annoying) but once I was able to hide long enough to find a gun (trailer park was a good start) I was good to go. 

Game developers, there seems to be a lack of documentation available to new players. Please address this, I could see a less experienced gamer getting discouraged very quickly..

Would love it if you could load the game and then have a period of god mode until you move, the game takes forever to load up sometimes you get bored and walk away resulting in death and time wasted..."
user_76561198185498354,"It's a shame that a game with such a cool concept gets to be one of the biggest cancers i've ever played due to the dogshit developers it unfortunately has. Pay2Win, crashing simulator, bugs after bugs. Everything bad you could think of, this game definitely has it. No wonder it went free to play, nobody would give a single coin to play this pile of shit.
 
EDIT: less than 1 minute after writing this review, i loaded the game and it crashed right on the load screen. Great game indeed."
user_76561198090255342,"Where to start, ISS was a crap game to begin with, low fps, and stability issues. this game just amplifies that. Oh but there are about 5 military grade guns in every house. so when you do log in finding weapons is a breeze. in short. to not buy this unpolished turt
"
user_76561198119530483,"At first, I didn't understan why so many people hated this game.

When I first launched it, it made me sign up for an account, it was a bit of an inconvenience, but not horrible.

I entered a server, and the loading time took around two minutes, so then I thought: ""Well if it takes this long to load, it must have stunning graphics. Right?""

No.

The tree's leaves looked smudged, the grass was just a single color, and the sky, wasn't that bad.

""Okay, maybe the character animations are good."" I said. 

Nyet

I took a swim, and the regular swim animation is fine, not very realistic, but fine. But then I pressed shift. You break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing Olympic swimmer. The sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying.

""Okay, once I find some itens, it'll be more fun.""

Nein

I wasn't able to find any items because I was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower. ""Well shit!"" I say, ""At least I'll respawn instantly.""

Nie

You have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often. If you want to spawn back in instantly, you have to use-

ECHHH

Just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach. You have to use... In.... Game.... Currency.....

At this point I'm so fed up I uninstall it as fast as possible.





10000000000000000/10 would uninstall again."
user_76561198024326228,"My experience with this game. Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways. Bad graphics, horrendous lag and frame drops while playing, you spend most of the time doing nothing, just walking and wondering around with not objectives and story at all."
user_76561198242097686,"let me tell you one thing, the game crashes only when you : shoot pistols, shoot, throw grenades, put dont riot shield, disconnect from the server, join a server, kill a zombie, jump on a zombie, kill a player, slide down a mountian, go in a car, go out of a car, crouch, jump on something, prone or just moving..."

was gonna put $ into the game to make it better"
user_76561198082104074,"Campers,campers and more campers everywhere.I am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive.
The worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farm,kill or camp you.
It's more like a player survival not zombie."
user_76561198020730890,"Should be renamed the crashZ or code error 06 or code error 08, cos you see more of that than game time if you can log in and move past the 'starting updater' or 'one moment please'

connections very poor to servers if you can connect.

good game when it works"
user_76561198021186338,"The game has potential however it has severe issues with disconnections.  This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.

I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.  

Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.

For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!

To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.

Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."
user_76561198150414480,You really should rethink the spawning and making the toons GLOW BRIGHT ASS GREEN. It just make you a giant target/ beacon to be hunted when spawning at dusk or night time. Hell if you have enough field of vision being elevated you can see new spawns in the forest during the day with a scope outside the cities. IT's LIKE HEY IM SPAWNING HERE! GIMMIE 30 SECONDS FOR MY RESPAWN SHIELD TO FALL OFF AND YOU CAN UNLOAD AN ENTIRE CLIP OF 552 AMMO INTO MY BACK. When I just spawned 50 seconds ago and the dude just tracked me till the shield fell off.......... Real shit and down fall to this game.
user_76561198152649489,"Full of Hackers, Spawn zone always camped, lose all gear on death. No fun if you keep getting spawn killed wait 4 mins to log back in to be killed while loading back in."
user_76561198070218954,"I got ban after i was killed by a hacker...  their anti cheat is a fail, good game but the developper dont care about the community so dont play you will be ban ... I am very disapointed I hop this game will close"
user_76561198129673078,"Ok first of all, I find this game very enjoyable mostly because i have other friends that i can play with. You can collect items and just absolutely rule bigginer servers or you can use begginer servers to your advantage and collect really good items and and head into official servers so you have better guns that you can use to kill harder enemies. PVP servers are joke, mostly because you have pro players that have op sniper rifles and dominate your ass. i would like it alot if the developers would add an option that would allow you to sell your scavenges items that you dont need. That pale white zombie that is as tall as shaquille o'neal needs to be nerfed please. That really annoys me once you get to a base and loot it then find that thing there and have to waste all of youre mags on it that is quite annoying. Overall its quite a steady game which i enjoy playing with my friends and i defintely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wasting a few hours with youre friends on this game."
user_76561198149667067,"this game looks super cool, but i cant play it because it takes 10-15 minutes to load a game, and when it finnaly loads, it disconnects from the server. is there a fix for this issue? please i want to play this game, it looks really cool."
user_76561198021745288, please fix this broke ass game. You need to fix the issue where if you get your car stuck you cannot exit. WTF is that anyway. Also you need to fix the fact that if you fall in between a barricade and a sandbag like the set up in Caliwood near stadium in military zone with super zombie. There are so many other little things like this that have been adding up lately and making for a horrible gaming experience. I have been playing infestation for a long time now. you guys are doing a lot better than the other losers thats for sure. I have lost too many spawners to these bugs its bullshit.
user_76561198225953896,"I was positively surprised by this game. I download and test out F2P games as soon as they get released on steam, and usually I delete them 20 minutes after starting, as they mostly suck. Wasn't the case here, I very much liked it, even recommended it to my friends. It's like a f2p version of DayZ, but it's even better in some ways. Of course, there are tons of things to fix.

First of which will be the bugs. It's really buggy. Like for every 1 hour of gameplay, the game would crash and kick me at least 1 time. I have absolutely no explanation why, it just happens, and it happens to everybody, not just me. Also sometimes when you join a server it would immediately disconnect you for no reason, and you'll have to reconnect after. It's kinda annoying. Another thing that could be fixed is the fps drop. My PC covers the game on recommended settings entirely, yet even on low graphics I get FPS drops to 10 fps. 

It would be fun if the developers introduce a way to build bases in the game, that would be it much more fun, the way it's in Rust. We already have barricades, but it's not the same. It would be amazing if you could build your own settlements and install spawning points there. More vehicles could also be useful, permanent of course. It's annoying to lose expensive stuff and having to buy it all over again, dunno if it's that way with the current vehicles, still can't afford one.

Other than that, the game is very fun.  One of the small amount of F2P games which aren't P2W, money is purely for cosmetical reasons and some boosts, which you can obtain even with a F2P account. I hope they keep it that way and don't ruin it. Also the weapon arsenal is HUGE! You can also customize your weapons and add gadgets and skins. They made it in a very professional way without ruining the RPG elements, but still maintaining a realistic combat.

The community is growing by each day, it has just recently surpassed DayZ's numbers, when speaking about active players.

Overall, it has some issues, there are things that can be improved and added, but if you are unsure whether or not to download it or not, TRY IT! You won't regret it!"
user_76561198214094857,Reminds me of Romeros Aftermath. I loved that game so much so this a great game with great memories. Also the variation of types of zombies is cool.
user_76561198170365929,"spawns into game to trys to play... Gets spawned killed.
Ok bad spawn tries again on another server. Gets sniped after taking one step.
2 in a row ok 3rd time the charm. Fucking run into group of 3 guys ofter my first few steps get killed. im done dont play this shit game."
user_76561198186003728,"~~OLD REVIEW, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT~~
It's a good game, with pros and cons.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Good AntiCheat(RIP MLG AC), unlike VAC -_-
[*]There are lots of weapons to get
[*]Kinda RPG like XP system
[*]Pretty big maps if you like exploring, small if you like PvP.
[*]HUGE market
[*]Can easily hop in a game
[*]Battle Royale is basically free H1Z1: KotK.
[*]Fun with friends.
Cons:
[*]A teensy weensy bit Pay2Win(skins are VERY VERY VERY rare to find; expensive to buy with GC)
[*]WAY too buggy(getting randomly disconnected; killed while connecting; couldn't connect; kicked for being suspicious etc)
[*]God damnit just WHY? If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.
[*]WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.
[*] Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?
[/list]
TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.

Edit(like 3 years later)- was heavily biased when I wrote this. The game is pretty mediocre in hindsight, so yeah."
user_76561198145981218,"Great game!

I played 1 hour on a begginer's server so I can join the battle royale. The most boring hour in my life, the servers are empty, few zombies and very weak, no cars(or I didn't find one).
After that I joined the battle royale...the ultimate clown fiesta.

It reminds me of the early days of H1Z1, but worst and for poor people.
I'll go back to my cave and play HuniePop"
user_76561198068847526,"  To answer the question if this game is worth downloading, my answer would be yes and no.  Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.  

  A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."
user_76561198035680216,"Bullshit game, cant properly make spawns, everytime i spawn i manage to spawn right on top of someone who chases me down till my shield is down and just kills me, even if i create a new character the same shit happens, and im blowing through igc respawning, fuck this game
"
user_76561198005153694,"I give the game 1/10 because it is unplayable as it is....... every 5-10min you have crash, dc or get kicked from server, the anticheat is garbage and hackers are roaming free(like 80% are cheating), sadly the devs and most mods are just trashtalking everyone who trys to point out problems or help them to improve their game.

The game wasen´t allways in such a bad state, so 9/10 for the Game how it was long ago but constant wiping things out of peoples inventories, which they traded or bought with real money and useless updates which make the game crash all the time got it down to 1/10

I really don´t recomend this game to anyone exept you want to cheat........"
user_76561198058429834,"Although you may find some fun in playing with your friends, I assure you that the problems you will encounter will stack up quickly. First being that if you click anywhere off the screen, which does not lock the mouse to the window, the game will crash and, if you don't stop the application, you can still die and lose your items. Second is enemy attacks make no sound and your character has no reaction, so you'll probably die without even knowing it. Third, you spawn in semi-random areas that do not guarentee safety, even though you have spawn protection. A majority of spawing will involve you being either surrounded by zombies or killed by snipers who are waiting. These primary issues do not take in the fact that the physics are terrible and the graphics are usually flat textures, even when set to high. I would not recommend this game to anyone no matter how popular they say they are."
user_76561198308601193,"This game is decent. I'll explain in pros and cons:

Pros:
PvE and PvP servers actually work
Vehicles
Large map
Variety of guns
Multiple zombies in one area
Easy to understand
Variety of characters

Cons:
People camp spawns in PvP
No lootable crates
Only 3 types of vehicles
Have to pay in order to get different characters
Can have your car blown up with you in it
People can steal your car even if you got it with your own money
Crafting system not implimented (YET)
Needs Better graphics

I do recomend the game to a certian extent. If you like to run long distances to get to places then play this game."
user_76561198053862446,"I've only played for like an hour and I already know it's absolute garbage.
[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
    [*]The swimming animation looks funny
[/list]
[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
    [*]Having to wait three minutes as a penalty for dying once is beyond stupid when both NPCs and other online players are trying to kill you.
    [*]The map is way too open and spread out, you'll most often be running for extensive amounts of time to wherever you need to go (whether or not you can eventually get a car or something like that is beyond my knowledge, I kept on friggin dying before I could make any significant progress in that regard)
    [*]Microtransactions up the butt, as if anyone wants to succumb to this ""premium account"" BS
    [*]The main menu is very disorganized and confusing to navigate
[/list]
I dunno, I could probably come up with more cons had I spent more time with this but I can't be bothered to put myself through any more of this awful game, so consider that a con in itself. These DayZ/Rust/H1Z1-esque survival games need to stop because honestly it's ridiculous how incomplete they feel."
user_76561198192656667,"Вы знаете что такое оптимизация? Да ? А я нет. Даная игра находясь в категории ""Бесплатные"" имеет и плюсы и минусы.
Начну пожалуй с плюсов:
1- Донат не решает ничего.
2-Топ лут можно собрать за пару часов игры.
3-Огромные количества лута,разнообразие оружий
4-Скины.Данное ввидение игру никак не портит,но мне кажется лучше бы занялись минусами.Да и сами скины просто радуют глаза.Но и покупать их ненужно.Можно побегать по локации и налутать кейсы со скинами.
5-Машины.В этой игре есть транспорт.Его хоть и немного (1-3)шт.Благодаря им можно съэкономить время,нервы и тд.
6-Ранообразие . Различные режимы,Battle Royale,PVP?PVE,режим Крепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.
7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.
8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.
9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.
Минусы:
1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).
2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).
3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.
4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!

В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!
В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.
Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!
 

English
You know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.
Perhaps I'll start with the pros:
1 - donut does not solve anything.
2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.
3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons
4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.
5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.
6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes Battle Royale,PVP?PVE mode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.
7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.
8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.
9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.
Cons:
1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).
2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).
3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.
4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!

In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!
In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.
But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL FUCK UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!

user_76561198015779520,"They keep saying they patch the game, Yet the game freezes, log back in your dead and all your loot is gone.  The buggy you bought, the sniper rounds you bought all gone."
user_76561198084845682,"Wow! this game for a free to play is pretty amazing of coures theres lag and such but what game dosent have that. This is a game that feels alot like a H1Z1/DayZ hybrid and it works. There is a subscription they offer its like $2.50 a month for the lowest pack or up to $10 for the best pack and thats strictly up to you if you want to buy it. 

       You can go thru the whole game and still have as much fun as the next guy just no premium severs but who needs those am I right. But with that being said for a free to play zombie survival game you cant go wrong so I give this game a cool 7/10 it is GOOD!"

user_76561198335996959,Shattered skies is free to play on there public website sadly not on steam because steam does not allow them to change it make shattered skies great again http://forum.playshatteredskies.com/ that is official website. It is a massive surviving pvp type of game.
user_76561197998973083,"O jogo é divertido quando jogado com amigos, bem bacana, porém ele vem de uma engine não muito boa que possui muitos bugs que causam crashs e dc's aleatórios, mas isso não me impede de me divertir. Se caso a ideia desse jogo fosse levada para outra engine, ou mesmo bons programadores conseguissem ajustar essa seria definitivamente um jogo excelente, o skill gap é alto,  você tem que ser bom para matar no jogo, o premium é barato, e aluguel de servidor fica extremamente barato quanto repartido com seus amigos para lootear, sem contar os eventos que eles proporcionam ocasionalmente dando uma diversão à mais, exceto as árvores de natal que causaram varios problemas com todos. :)              Good game, Not Pay to win GG"
user_76561198136225235,"This game has a very steep learning curv and it dosent help when higer level players with lots of experience playing the game camp the looting areas in the beginner servers. the fact that there is some kind of heros and bandits system is very strange because everyone shoots on sight, bandit or not. the community on arma 3 exile, breaking point and wasteland are lots better. 

the game feels like its still alpha. has jerky controls, has 3rd person view which breaks immersion and used to cheat. your enemys will often glitch their guns through walls and shoot leaving you unable to shoot back because u cant hit them. people will often jump around which makes it hard to headshot them. jumping requires no stamina!

but at least ist not pay to win.
its pay to skin!
and it has good fps.

its very sad to see advanced players joining beginner servers and killing new players to feel better about themselves."
user_76561198018532676,Absolute garbage game played it for over a year no progression Devs just spawn in 1000 of items for certain players. No progression on the game at all no patches. No fixes nothing at all really. Minor bugs takes months to get barely fixed.
user_76561197999753914,"*** Edit****
I have removed this game from my library as it kept asking for me to turn off my firewall and anti virus and I will not them off for any game.

Ok where to start, I do have to say this game is fun, yes it still has a few bugs in it and yes it take time to move around from place to place but over all its a fun game and more fun with friends. 
I like the skill tree aspect as it can help your player survice more. yes there are people onthe servers that shoot you on sight but most open world games for multi player are like this.
but at the same time there are a few great players out there that will help.
it has servers for people just starting to play and then once you hit the limit on the noob servers you then move to the normal servers.
they Dev are working on the games all the time tring to fix things so all the people making bad comments are either just bad players or just don't understand that the Dev are doing the best they can and it take a lot to make a game like this.
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes openworld, zombie games.
yes it a bit rough right now but the game has a lot of potential to become great. 
don't be fooled by any review's by people that don't put anytime into the game if they have less then 5 hours playing then they havn't given the game a chance.
my Over all review is get the game have fun thats whta games are for, give the Dev feed back about what is good and what is bad and give them time to fix things."
user_76561198136423313,It crashes very often but if that was to be fixed it would make the number of rage quits go down but besides that it is a playable game (until it crashes every 15-20 mins )
user_76561197979798776,"Tras jugarlo bastante, puedo admitir que parece interesante. Hasta que te das cuenta que es un juego de caza al respawn. Según sales te matan, da igual el sitio, da igual el servidor. Y teniendo en cuenta que empiezas ""a pelo"" es muy triste. He tenido buenos momentos. Pero las zona de bosque están muy muy abandonadas, no hay nada, no hay nada que hacer, son zona de paso. Y las zonas de ciudad son interesantes, salvo por el detalle de respawn. Que es algo enervante."
user_76561198002524967,"Free to play game, which could be a great excuse for its flaws. This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.

Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.

As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."
user_76561198200635095,"I can't learn any thing about the game since i just start even when you just response from dead u get kill instantly.
They don give us like PVE server to walk around and see. Not a single chance given in game just."
user_76561198100870823,Can't even play the game. Friend tried to spawn in and was killed immediatly. once you die you have to wait for 2 minutes to even respawn and after you respone you have to wait another two minutes just to even get back in the server. Don't even bother playing the game because you are limited to 12 hours of free gameplay until you have to pay for a suscription that's not even worth it.
user_76561198016859696,"I have around 140 hours of gameplay at this moment. I recommend this game but only for first 72 hours of gameplay. I will elaborate.
When you start you are left with some food, flashlight and small backpack. After that you start scavanging villages and cities on map. You collect items, kill zombies and you stock your global inventory with weapons, ammo and other stuff. Global inventory functionate like a bank. You deposit items that nobody can take and you can access them from the lobby or in settlements on maps. 
After a while, or just instantly, you notice that other players are mostly open for PVP and will probably shoot you. So you have to be careful and sneaky around the map. 
First 72 hours you can access beginner servers, after that you can't play there anymore. There are official servers that are almost the same as beginner servers.

That being said I will elaborate why I decided to quit this. 
I played this with 3 other friends and we were running around map from town to town and we scavanged places and fought with zombies and people. It was a masterpiece of the game for us. We really have got into it. It was so realistic and great for us. After I reached 72 hours of gameplay beginner servers became locked for me and I wasn't able to access it. So we started to play on official servers. 
OFFICIAL SERVERS are something terrible. This game is supposed to be open world pvp.. but it is not. It is open world, but PVP are only in several zones.. like 3-4 hot-zones that people on server visit. Nobody scavanges anymore at that point. You can travel across the map and you won't find a single player on your adventure. But as you come closer to one of those hotzones you start hearing countless snipers. And then you die before you stepped there. It is simply what this game is like. Beginner servers are supossed to be for beginners but they are not. So many people camp other newbies because they can. But on official, nobody travels around the map. If you want to fight you have to go into those hot zones and you will probably get camped by players who are already inside the city. 

Fight versus players is farce. Jumping around or hiding behind riot shields with snipers.. it is terrible. It feels like some childish carnival. 

tldr;
If you want to play open world pvp zombie survival game, I do recommend it but for first 72 hours. After that forget it. 

I made my review before when I played on beginner servers and it was awesome. Now, after you leave beginner servers this game is just not the same. It is awful. And devs said they care about players and their opinions on this game which isn't true. I posted on forums about this beginner-official server issues and they just ignored it. 

Btw, countless dcs, some hackers, stupid jumping around the riot shields, too many servers with too few players on servers. 

Game is good, but devs managed it so poorly."
user_76561198167101392,"There are a lot of errors during the game and it bounces.
And if you die in the middle of a bump, everything will fly away.
Compensation is also not allowed.
I enjoyed it but I was disappointed in running the game.
I will never enjoy your game again.
Fuck you."
user_76561198083478857,"played the original from day one even bought it from the original infestation website , when that game died off because of too many hackers and bugs i gave up on infestation anything , but playing this new release and knowing how the game used to be in the past this game is the most ! stable it has ever been out of all the releases and less bugs than the last few years that I actually enjoy playing it with friends again as long as they keep the cheaters away from taking over the game im sure this game will become even more popular now that things are more stable."
user_76561198042233832,"basically a copy and paste of The War Z, Also known as Infestation survival stories. itd be nice if they gave the people that purchased the game originally some kind of GC set or something since we previously bought it and these aholes decided to abandon their original game, but here it is again free to play. 
Reason i do not recommend : too many hackers, too many spawn killers, not enough updates, everythings the same as it was like 5 years ago other than now its free to play and california map is here
reason to play: if you like to kill zombies and explore and loot, its a good game if you buy your own server and prevent anyone from joining."
user_76561198041148162,These guys These new devs got it right the other devs released this and didnt give a fuck what people thought i gotta hand it to these new devs they did quite a good job a little trial and error you know there can be some inprovement remove the respawn time and fix the server issues thats all
user_76561198051104745,"Quickly getting boring, zombies are to weak...
There is one simple thing to get rid of zombies, attack them im melee, just kill 4 of them and you get eough cash (600) to get the knife from the store, the its just walking to them and stabbing 3 times, and if you circle around them they will miss you approx. 95% of the time...
For encounters of the other survivors (players) just take a rifle and a snipe with you and you are fine...
Further within 1,5 ingame ours i could have gathered over 30 guns for my global inventory, meaning 5 snipes, various SMG and around 10 kind of rifles and suitable ammo in the hundreds.

Its way to easy to survive, you dont even have to look for food, beacuse of killing zombies you get enough to buy it in the marketplace..."
user_76561198361650048,"game is getting better, but it take so much time for small improve.
skins are way to keep game up but, they're terrible, looks like created in paint totally not accurate to SURVIVAL game.
Survival mode needs more improvements, open world( aka pvp and items farm) is not the way that game shoudl go with.

for solo players 5.5/10
playing with friends 7/10"
user_76561198176230815,"game constantly crashes, and you constantly loose you items from the crashes, the devs of this game give priority to streamers and discriminate against anyone not promoting there product . they also make major changes to the game that effect the economy and they tell the streamers days in advance so they can ""cash out"" this again is treating non streamers different to the consumers, they have outrageous game rules including one where they claim to ban you from the internet if you breech term 17, they breech consumer law by stating they will ban any person who applies for a refund  of in game purchases on all accounts they own (even if for valid reasons) , they also claim macroing is banable , they ban regular players but when streamers do tutorials on macroing this game they refuse to ban them, all in all if you download this don't expect to be treated fairly by the devs or support if you don't stream and expect the game to crash at least every 30 minutes, worse bit is when it crashes it leaves you in world and you will always be dead and loose all your gear upon re-log"
user_76561198093626977,"Fix this fucking game. all it is, is disconnections and crashes. When I get a good kill the shit says item being saved then I can't pick it up. Don't release a game that's worse then DayZ waste of my fucking time."
user_76561198071455093,"Game is incredibly laggy. Tried to start on several different servers to no avail. After 15-20m of server hopping just trying to get into one, I finally managed and it was so glitchy that everytime I moved, the entire screen would freeze. Got attacked by a zomie, was unable to defend myself and died. And then the loop repeated, being unable to find a server that would even let me play. I kept getting msg (Disconnected From Server)."
user_76561198095093908,"the game has really improved! i love it overall the gameplay and the new stuff. 
but for now the vehicles? are not available for me yet not sure maybe it applies to all players. 
and for those who have trouble connecting try uninstalling REALTEK audio driver that works for me. 

but suddenly i got banned for no good reason..... the only applications i got was bittorrent. so whats wrong? that i wouldn't know. plus i had good time grining in this account so its kinda sad to let it just banned."
