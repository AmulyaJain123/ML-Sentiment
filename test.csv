"After 11 years of rampant cheating, they decided to add an anti cheat yesterday. 
They picked on that is not compatible with linux, unless they literally check a box, which they did not do and said they will not do. So all linux users, including all steam decks, now cant play the game. just straight up locked out. I will be trying to get my money back, and you'll never catch me giving Rockstar money ever again. This is the last straw for me. I do not reccoment this game, or red dead, or gta 6. This company will cheat you out of every cent they can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GTA V singleplayer
100% fun

GTA V online
40% loading screens
20% actually playing
20% players leaving heists
20% ""network error"" (potato servers)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spend 370 Hours grinding cash
Rockstar detects too much cash and assumes its modded
banned
repeat 


10/10 would get banned again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out.
DO NOT BUY ON STEAM! Rockstar has disabled GTA Online for Steam Deck players. BattleEye IS compatible with Steam Deck, Rockstar is just CHOOSING to cut us off!  I will never trust a Rockstar game ever again.  Trash company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GTAV online is ruined by modding. My character was artificially leveled and i was given a bunch of achievements within a second. I still have fun in invite only servers with my friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rockstar does it again. Understand that the people that work there are a bunch of azzgoblins hellbent on making you have the worst experience possible until you eventually hate GTAO and quit playing it, or at least quit playing it. 
In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I am so glad I never bought Red Dead Redemtion2 and I will never get GTA6. You probably shouldn't either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What the actual f..... My account earned a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe and for what?... Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Game is fun, but can't be played by linux or steam deck users now. Modders will be back in a week but linux players won't. Refund the game under Steam Play Issues if you are a linux user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New lovely thing happening where battleye constantly requires an update and kicks me out of GTA ONLINE after I complete a job. I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD. These developers need to get their shit together or im just gonna be one of the many people who dont pre order or buy GTA 6. Developers, you have our trust, DONT LOSE IT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"- Implemented anti cheat after a decade and picked the worst one to do it
- Linux support went to shit for online mode
- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shafted Linux Support and blamed the Steam Deck for not supporting the Anti-Cheat when Proton supports it, they blamed Steam Deck because they could not be asked to request to BattlEye to enable Linux Support, it's not that difficult, Rockstar!

After being mistreated, blocked from fixing my contact details, my username, not even letting me migrate my PS4 character to PC, or anything like that, I am done, I'm deleting this game and going elsewhere. Screw you Rockstar! >:(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
