good replay value
good gameplay, the parkour is nice, the combat is miles better than ac2 (for me at least) and killstreaks are fun
good story, nice continuation to ezio's story after ac2
good visuals especially for its time

cons:
uplay
ubisoft"
user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."
user_76561198239944820,"Crashes multiple times during a few hours of playing, and after a few days of crashes resulted in corrupted save."
user_76561199267090179,"I played this ones in my childhood and decided to replay the entire Desmond`s story again.
After completing Mirage and others chapters of modern Assassin`s Creed games, Brotherhood feels like fresh air.
-The gameplay is as interesting as it could have been at the time of the release of this game, and even more
-Amazing character development
-Plot that evokes emotions and does not make you yawn while playing 
Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"
user_76561198010879701,I enjoy the story line and how it flirts with known history
user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."
user_76561198328028442,"An amazing continuation of Ezio’s story, with improvements in graphics and some new weapons."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."
user_76561199447546178,Great game story is a bit short 3 best game for me in the franchise but that is only for me (other people put it higher) but still download it now lets support this bad new Ubisoft so they make good games like the old ones that we all like.

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable.

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short

3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."
user_76561198063650203,"Multiplayer is gone, not much use in purchasing anymore :("
user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun.

Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

I have two other working Ubisoft Connect launchers games AC2 and Driver with latest Ubisoft Connect launchers, and even Assassin’s Creed® Brotherhood has the latest Ubisoft Connect launcher."
user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."
user_76561199447546178,Great game story is a bit short 3 best game for me in the franchise but that is only for me (other people put it higher) but still download it now lets support this bad new Ubisoft so they make good games like the old ones that we all like.

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable.

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work.

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."

Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

+ Great story
+ Same great characters
+ I really liked the assassin recruit feature
+ In game achievements
+ Marked collectibles 

- Felt like an AC2 clone
- On my end the game constantly stuttered and I was unable to Alt Tab
- 3 in game achievements are unobtainable due to UPlay being shut down"

3. always online

user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."

user_76561198041196039,"still the best one in franchise

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561198096255747,"it was fine for a while. Stopped playing and now the Ubisoft Launcher asks password every time! this game has become a nightmare to play on my steam deck. the game is good however:
1. no cloud saves
2. prompt for password and 2factor everytime, this is a nightmare on steamdeck
3. always online
Pirates here are getting the best deal than ppl that actually bought it. last time I give money to Ubisoft."
user_76561199401259865,The game just lags and lot of sluttering just fuck it ubisoft u just destroyed a masterpiece
user_76561198350609389,"love the game, solid 9/10. I cannot recommend you buy it though because i physically cannot open the game, i press play and it starts up i get to a screen thats white and black then it crashes, every single time. dont buy this. ubisoft connect F'd it all up."
user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."
user_76561198276404310,"Beautiful game, when “Rome Countryside” plays it teleports you right into the game."
user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short

1. Download a 300MB mod with a bunch of fixes and improvements

3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing
I have to do this every single time I want to run it."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it.

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

Enjoy Ezio in his golden times!"
user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561199267090179,"I played this ones in my childhood and decided to replay the entire Desmond`s story again.
After completing Mirage and others chapters of modern Assassin`s Creed games, Brotherhood feels like fresh air.
-The gameplay is as interesting as it could have been at the time of the release of this game, and even more
-Amazing character development
-Plot that evokes emotions and does not make you yawn while playing 
Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

-Amazing character development
-Plot that evokes emotions and does not make you yawn while playing 
Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short

3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."

    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561199067093712,Picking this up for at my local Blockbuster in 2011 was one of the best decisions I ever made
user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work.

They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

Everything is permitted. 

We work in the dark to serve the light, we are Assassins."
user_76561198048763027,"Great sequel to AC2, was great fun finishing it. Would recommend at a discount."
user_76561198035528922,"really hard to overstate how bad ubisoft support are, and you're forced to play via a ubisoft account. AVOID!"
user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."
user_76561198137812727,"An amazing refinement on the mechanics of AC2. Peak of the series, actually. Pure fun."
user_76561197986398583,"This was the high point of the Assassin's Creed series. Full stop.

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."
user_76561199479039263,"I love all in this game. including the history, places, dynamic and aspect."
user_76561198041196039,"still the best one in franchise

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short
user_76561198134672213,"One of the best of the saga, although it's almost as if it were just a DLC of AC2. Good story, quests a bit repetitive but better than newest ones."
user_76561198906127976,"In order to play this game, I have to
1. Download a 300MB mod with a bunch of fixes and improvements
2. Run the game through the mod, selecting a bunch of shit every time
3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing
I have to do this every single time I want to run it."
user_76561199493504352,"For me its not the Best game as if yet that For me the best AC Game is assassin's creed 3 although they remastered the game It still give's me nostalgia and How the graphics is made for assassin's creed 3 although this game is not the type i was expected in the photos though it was an old game i will still give it a 5/10 bc of how hard the devs prob spent making this game.

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

+ Great story
+ Same great characters
+ I really liked the assassin recruit feature
+ In game achievements
+ Marked collectibles 

- Felt like an AC2 clone
- On my end the game constantly stuttered and I was unable to Alt Tab
- 3 in game achievements are unobtainable due to UPlay being shut down"

1. no cloud saves
2. prompt for password and 2factor everytime, this is a nightmare on steamdeck
3. always online
Pirates here are getting the best deal than ppl that actually bought it. last time I give money to Ubisoft."
user_76561199401259865,The game just lags and lot of sluttering just fuck it ubisoft u just destroyed a masterpiece
user_76561198350609389,"love the game, solid 9/10. I cannot recommend you buy it though because i physically cannot open the game, i press play and it starts up i get to a screen thats white and black then it crashes, every single time. dont buy this. ubisoft connect F'd it all up."
user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):

    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."
user_76561199479039263,"I love all in this game. including the history, places, dynamic and aspect."
user_76561198041196039,"still the best one in franchise

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable.

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561199267090179,"I played this ones in my childhood and decided to replay the entire Desmond`s story again.
After completing Mirage and others chapters of modern Assassin`s Creed games, Brotherhood feels like fresh air.
-The gameplay is as interesting as it could have been at the time of the release of this game, and even more
-Amazing character development
-Plot that evokes emotions and does not make you yawn while playing 
Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short
user_76561198134672213,"One of the best of the saga, although it's almost as if it were just a DLC of AC2. Good story, quests a bit repetitive but better than newest ones."
user_76561198906127976,"In order to play this game, I have to
1. Download a 300MB mod with a bunch of fixes and improvements
2. Run the game through the mod, selecting a bunch of shit every time
3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing
I have to do this every single time I want to run it."
user_76561199493504352,"For me its not the Best game as if yet that For me the best AC Game is assassin's creed 3 although they remastered the game It still give's me nostalgia and How the graphics is made for assassin's creed 3 although this game is not the type i was expected in the photos though it was an old game i will still give it a 5/10 bc of how hard the devs prob spent making this game.

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2.

The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work.

They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

Everything is permitted. 

We work in the dark to serve the light, we are Assassins."
user_76561198048763027,"Great sequel to AC2, was great fun finishing it. Would recommend at a discount."
user_76561198035528922,"really hard to overstate how bad ubisoft support are, and you're forced to play via a ubisoft account. AVOID!"
user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."
user_76561198137812727,"An amazing refinement on the mechanics of AC2. Peak of the series, actually. Pure fun."
user_76561197986398583,"This was the high point of the Assassin's Creed series. Full stop.

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."
user_76561199479039263,"I love all in this game. including the history, places, dynamic and aspect."
user_76561198041196039,"still the best one in franchise

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short
user_76561198134672213,"One of the best of the saga, although it's almost as if it were just a DLC of AC2. Good story, quests a bit repetitive but better than newest ones."
user_76561198906127976,"In order to play this game, I have to
1. Download a 300MB mod with a bunch of fixes and improvements
2. Run the game through the mod, selecting a bunch of shit every time
3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing
I have to do this every single time I want to run it."
user_76561199493504352,"For me its not the Best game as if yet that For me the best AC Game is assassin's creed 3 although they remastered the game It still give's me nostalgia and How the graphics is made for assassin's creed 3 although this game is not the type i was expected in the photos though it was an old game i will still give it a 5/10 bc of how hard the devs prob spent making this game.

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

+ Great story
+ Same great characters
+ I really liked the assassin recruit feature
+ In game achievements
+ Marked collectibles 

- Felt like an AC2 clone
- On my end the game constantly stuttered and I was unable to Alt Tab
- 3 in game achievements are unobtainable due to UPlay being shut down"

1. no cloud saves
2. prompt for password and 2factor everytime, this is a nightmare on steamdeck
3. always online
Pirates here are getting the best deal than ppl that actually bought it. last time I give money to Ubisoft."
user_76561199401259865,The game just lags and lot of sluttering just fuck it ubisoft u just destroyed a masterpiece
user_76561198350609389,"love the game, solid 9/10. I cannot recommend you buy it though because i physically cannot open the game, i press play and it starts up i get to a screen thats white and black then it crashes, every single time. dont buy this. ubisoft connect F'd it all up."
user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):

    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."
user_76561199479039263,"I love all in this game. including the history, places, dynamic and aspect."
user_76561198041196039,"still the best one in franchise

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable.

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561199267090179,"I played this ones in my childhood and decided to replay the entire Desmond`s story again.
After completing Mirage and others chapters of modern Assassin`s Creed games, Brotherhood feels like fresh air.
-The gameplay is as interesting as it could have been at the time of the release of this game, and even more
-Amazing character development
-Plot that evokes emotions and does not make you yawn while playing 
Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short
user_76561198134672213,"One of the best of the saga, although it's almost as if it were just a DLC of AC2. Good story, quests a bit repetitive but better than newest ones."
user_76561198906127976,"In order to play this game, I have to
1. Download a 300MB mod with a bunch of fixes and improvements
2. Run the game through the mod, selecting a bunch of shit every time
3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing
I have to do this every single time I want to run it."
user_76561199493504352,"For me its not the Best game as if yet that For me the best AC Game is assassin's creed 3 although they remastered the game It still give's me nostalgia and How the graphics is made for assassin's creed 3 although this game is not the type i was expected in the photos though it was an old game i will still give it a 5/10 bc of how hard the devs prob spent making this game.

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2.

The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work.

They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

Everything is permitted. 

We work in the dark to serve the light, we are Assassins."
user_76561198048763027,"Great sequel to AC2, was great fun finishing it. Would recommend at a discount."
user_76561198035528922,"really hard to overstate how bad ubisoft support are, and you're forced to play via a ubisoft account. AVOID!"
user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."
user_76561198137812727,"An amazing refinement on the mechanics of AC2. Peak of the series, actually. Pure fun."
user_76561197986398583,"This was the high point of the Assassin's Creed series. Full stop.

You should really play AC2 first, though. Trust me. I played this first, and it made a lot less sense."
user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."
user_76561199479039263,"I love all in this game. including the history, places, dynamic and aspect."
user_76561198041196039,"still the best one in franchise

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."
user_76561199465732313,its nice and fun but the story is pretty short
user_76561198134672213,"One of the best of the saga, although it's almost as if it were just a DLC of AC2. Good story, quests a bit repetitive but better than newest ones."
user_76561198906127976,"In order to play this game, I have to
1. Download a 300MB mod with a bunch of fixes and improvements
2. Run the game through the mod, selecting a bunch of shit every time
3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing
I have to do this every single time I want to run it."
user_76561199493504352,"For me its not the Best game as if yet that For me the best AC Game is assassin's creed 3 although they remastered the game It still give's me nostalgia and How the graphics is made for assassin's creed 3 although this game is not the type i was expected in the photos though it was an old game i will still give it a 5/10 bc of how hard the devs prob spent making this game.

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

+ Great story
+ Same great characters
+ I really liked the assassin recruit feature
+ In game achievements
+ Marked collectibles 

- Felt like an AC2 clone
- On my end the game constantly stuttered and I was unable to Alt Tab
- 3 in game achievements are unobtainable due to UPlay being shut down"

1. no cloud saves
2. prompt for password and 2factor everytime, this is a nightmare on steamdeck
3. always online
Pirates here are getting the best deal than ppl that actually bought it. last time I give money to Ubisoft."
user_76561199401259865,The game just lags and lot of sluttering just fuck it ubisoft u just destroyed a masterpiece
user_76561198350609389,"love the game, solid 9/10. I cannot recommend you buy it though because i physically cannot open the game, i press play and it starts up i get to a screen thats white and black then it crashes, every single time. dont buy this. ubisoft connect F'd it all up."
user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):

    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Most of the side characters from AC2 return, such as leonardo da vinci, and Claudia auditore and Maria auditore.

I recommend playing this game."
user_76561198079158997,"Very nice game. 
The audio sliders do not seem to affect certain sfx sounds in the game (croud speech volume, lifts, cannons, borgia towers exploding etc.). I fixed this by setting the sliders to maximum and controlling the game volume from volume mixer.
Crashing also stopped after manually locking the game to 60fps."

user_76561197991993302,"Direct sequel to AC2, ezio is back.
 

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react.

I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."

Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.
6.5/10

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561198373623939,"Brotherhood refines the combat, parkour and map compared to AC2 but it is shorter and although smoother, combat and parkour can feel a little too easy when compared to 2 and only having Rome to explore is a little boring, still a brilliant game and worth a play."
user_76561199479039263,"I love all in this game. including the history, places, dynamic and aspect."
user_76561198041196039,"still the best one in franchise

Ubisoft pls stop putting boring modern day abstergo crap nobody cares

i want to be ezio or ed kenway not boring office simulator thanks"
user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."
user_76561199135384438,"Absolutly, this game is from my childhood and would to see other players play this game and not this new assassins creed games lol keep it classic yall"
user_76561199541170223,lots of hearts and toooooo gooood story the way all things improve from AC 2 i love it and also cant wait to play ac revelution <3<3<3<3<3 :) ;)
user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

Plus, No family share."
user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."
user_76561198118120406,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who haven't yet had the opportunity to play this. Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561199084744781,Being able to create your own assassin cult is the peak of the franchise
user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

Consiglia di giocare! Approvato!"
user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

Despite the flaws I would definitely recommend this game!"

user_76561199612777801,"Great game, played it on xbox when it came out. good story, lots to do. (there are a couple of quests that are dependent on fps and literally impossible without messing with settings though)"
user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

user_76561197982583774,"Im just gonna copy my AC2 review more or less...

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."
user_76561197998113892,"The sequel that improved upon the 2nd game, furthering Ezio's story and managing to continue telling a good story. It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

Overall Score: 8/10"
user_76561199113331680,"Pretty good not gonna lie, its an improvement from AC2 (as it is a sequel), The graphics look pretty good and the killstreak feature is cool, releasing your own assassins on people is also really cool, though i think AC3 did it better.

Improved on AC2 in many ways. A little more less focused on being a serious game, has left the stealth as a side thing, focusing a lot on combat with the new gears."
user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"
user_76561199224450968,"this game is just wonderful i started with ac 2 and it was really good but this games way more advanced in color, fighting and the new mechanics are amazing in general, but the fact that I wanna perfect every mission it takes for me quite a time if ur thinking about buying the game and read this: ur getting touchies if u dont buy it"
user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."

Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)

user_76561198801977568,"Regardless of the story, the bugs and glitches are still present in the game. 
The worst part being, you may encounter the bug on pc right before completing the game which ruins your entire experience. I don't think its the responsibility of users to try different tweaks just to get over that bug but ubisoft to resolve it. 
After playing the newer titles, it seems that there is unnecessary hype for this title."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

user_76561199021607318," If you think of Brotherhood as a standalone dlc expansion to AC2 it's pretty good. It introduced some good stuff, some bad stuff, there's essentially no story, etc.

 Thing is it isn't a dlc of course, it was sold as a fully fledged sequel back in the day.
 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."
user_76561198195018289,"AC Brotherhood is the only AC game I hadn't played fully until now. I never got to finish it, as my Xbox was destroyed in a flood a bit after I started playing it. Playing it now, I can say I was missing out. The improvements on AC2 are very welcomed. Free running is more well defined than it was in AC 1 or 2, and the game is absolutely gorgeous, even for it's age. This is peak Assassins Creed."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

3. Launching task manager to disable CPU 0
4. Stay in game or I risk crashing

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."

user_76561199700499218,"This is back when Ubisoft truly knew how to craft compelling narratives and immersive experiences. This game delivers one of the most memorable villain endings in gaming history. The final encounter with Cesare Borgia is a masterclass in simple yet powerful storytelling. After a long chase across Rome, Ezio corners Cesare at the edge of a fortress. In a moment filled with arrogance, Cesare defiantly declares, “I will not die by the hand of man!” convinced that he is invincible. Without hesitation, Ezio quietly ends it by pushing Cesare to his death, letting fate take over. The weight of this moment, combined with Cesare's self-delusion, creates a scene of profound closure. It’s a perfect example of a character's downfall, crafted to leave a lasting impression and achieving cinematic excellence that captures the heavy cost of power and pride."
user_76561197982267489,"I used to love this game, played a lot on console. I can't recommend buying this on PC because of Ubisoft, Ubisoft Connect, and an uncertain future for the ability to continue playing this and their other titles.

user_76561198038434609,"One of my favorite games ever. A direct sequel to AC2 and an improvement in terms of game play, while the historical story is not quite as good. The modern day story is at the series peak. Rome is amazing to run around and Ezio is charming and cool."

Keep in mind that as of right now, the online servers are no longer operational so the deluxe DLC that perhaps you could buy or could have bought, no longer works. Now it requires mods to be functional. It is simply because the game is old so they are not working on it as much as they are the newer games."
user_76561199130516438,nice game definitely need to do everything else before the main missions. short story so you should do the L missions first and explore other stuff then (!) missions.
user_76561198987538377,"Brotherhood... is kinda a disappointment.
While Brotherhood is a nice jump in visual quality over AC2, it suffers in terms of story and presentation. The one map you explore, while quite large, is riddled with impassable cliffs that are not marked on your map. They try to remedy the huge map with fast travel but the fast travel menu is actually terrible. So navigation is a complete chore in the end.
Also there are so many tailing missions its actually horrendous. And a lot of times a mission requires you to follow a friendly NPC but my god I timed some of those segments and they can go as long as 5+ minutes of walking at a brisk-ish pace. This makes 100% synch a miserable experience that I decided early on that it would not be worth going for. This is made ESPECIALLY bad because if you fail a synch objective you cant just go back to the last checkpoint. Oh nonono that would be too easy. You need to restart the ENTIRE mission. And a lot of them have those walking segments at the beginning. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
The main reason I am so disappointed is the Steam store page frames Brotherhood as a game where the focus would be restoring Rome and maybe customizing it a bit, and raising baby assassins and maybe playing as them on missions or taking them with you as a buddy to get them exp and changing their clothes and stuff but I was dead wrong.
The ""Restoration"" that I was expecting turned out to be having to buy a shop before being able to buy from it. that's it. A first time purchase store tax.
As for raising assassins? You send them on missions and they come back after a set amount of playtime and gain experience so you can send them out again. The customization feature? You can choose their robes color. Until they reach rank 10. when they get to 10 they all have the same robes Ezio has. You can't even change the colors or anything so they take away the modicum of customization you have of them.
What a let-down."

user_76561198089518933,"Sequel to my favourite child hood game, Assassin's Creed 2. Overall, it feels a lot more modern than its predecessor and has aged noticeably better. The graphics have been improved, the UI is a lot clearer and its quest design gets a bit more variation.

With a much needed addition to its combat flow (thank you, execution streaks), this game plays a lot smoother than its two older brothers. Combat is no longer a constant ebb and flow of wait, parry, counter and is now a more active chaining of kills in a sort of priority list. This addition alone certainly makes you feel a lot more powerful and stronger than the previous titles did.

Its parkour system is virtually unchanged. The only major thing of note is the city now feels a bit more friendlier to the user to free roam in/on. Rooftops are closer together allowing for easier navigation, and there is more verticality which turns it more into a mini-game than a method of transportation. I personally really enjoyed this minor change.

The map however has taken a big hit. With the open world being reduced to a single map, and probably with the same size of one of AC2's maps, the city loses its charm a lot quicker than it did in the previous title. This is partially made up by it being Rome, with its vast monuments and well known buildings.

While the story continues the journey of Ezio and Desmond, the ending of Ezio's story feels extremely rushed. Sequence 8 and 9 barely last an hour combined, with no real guiding hand to really stitch it all together. You just blur from one scene to another. A bit more exposition and story would have helped a ton to ensure the player is able to follow along to what is actually happening. The Desmond story however ends with a massive cliffhanger that perfectly sets up what is to come (spoiler alert, good shit).

Another fun game-play addition is the recruit system, allowing the player to gather up a band of assassins who can aid Ezio in battle or go out and partake in their own missions for extra money/quest materials. They are relatively powerful and change up the flow of not only combat, but also regular exploration/traversal quite a bit.

To finish, this game holds up quite well compared to today's standards. Certainly worth playing if you are looking for either some historical tourism or a good action RPG."

user_76561198132203962,"Brotherhood takes the second game and makes it better. The best part is probably combat which has great flow and so fun. The story starts exactly where it ended last game (which is something I really liked). Music is amazing! I'd say it's better than music from AC2, but it's not as iconic. Another great thing is introduction of the brotherhood mechanic.
The game has often problems with camera (e. g. bad angles that can't be changed). The worst thing are timed tasks (especially Desmonds ""parkour test"" at the end)

user_76561197998690550,"This is the third AC game I have played - I am going through them in order. In my experience it was the best so far. Here’s why:
- True open word, without those rather annoying moves between cities.
- Rome is gorgeous. Climbing on top of the Colosseum and looking at the skyline of the ancient capital is truly something.
- Quests and side quests are not annoying. I guess this is in comparison with the AC1, where quite a few of them felt really repetitive.

If I had to find a downsides, here they are:
- Some 100% challenges are really annoying. If you fail the full sync criteria at the end of a long mission - welcome to redoing everything (and it can be a 10-15 minutes mission) from scratch.
- The whole “Brotherhood” situation feels rather unnecessary. Yes, it is fun to have an ability to kill everybody by whistling, but it feels foreign to the whole “lone assassin” idea, Besides, it is even less realistic than falling from rooftops into little piles of hay. Do those assassins follow Ezio everywhere waiting for a signal?
- Magic apple was weird and not fun. Good thing it was over rather quickly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. Playing as a skilled assassin in gorgeous historical settings - that’s all this series is about and AC2B really delivered that."

Game is OK. Ezio story is pretty decent. But the game overall has not aged well at all. Though, it is a step up in terms of graphics and combat compared to AC2 which is a nice touch. 

Controls are out right HORRIBLE yet again, one of the worst controls in a video game imo, even with a gamepad. I think i died and failed more of just Ezio leaping out of nowhere when climbing etc. Got really tedious real fast.

The game becomes very repetitive after a while (classic Open world ubisoft, climb tower, unlock area etc), there is more grind in this game when it comes to unlock weapons, upgrades etc compared to AC2, which i got tired of real fast. Collect different items to unlock different weapons, shop quests more or less. Gain more income? Then you will need to climp these stupid towers and burn them down to unlock that area and then be able to buy more shops in the area etc. I just played the story in the end.

Overall, its a 5/10. Grab it on sale."

It flounders at times but overall a decent sequel, even the multiplayer is enjoyable and this was when MP was being forced into a lot of single player games. In this instance it worked very well imo.

At this time however the modern day story was starting to fall apart, in the first two they were intriguing and engaging enough to be interesting. But here it started to really show how little they worked on it compared to the main game. But as a whole the game still stands as a decent enough sequel.

user_76561199465361589,"Dealing with the Ubisoft Launcher on a Steam Deck was a major pain. After successfully getting into the game, I thought never closing the app and using the Deck's sleep feature would keep me safe from interacting with the launcher again. However, towards the end of the story, the game crashed once and forced me to go through the whole process one more time. The game itself actually runs pretty well and looks good, though.

I'm somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assassin's Creed games, I neither hate nor love them. This has caused me to experience the series roughly one game per decade, giving myself just enough time to forget about the frustrating parts, which caused me to take such long brakes in the first place.

The first major pain point comes from the movement controls. Pretty important, considering the game is all about sneaking and parkour. When it works. it feels absolutely great to cruise through obstacles or set up an assassination just the way you want. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like the game does the exact opposite of what you want it to do. The direction Ezio moves in seems to be to some extent based on the direction the camera is facing, however the camera will change on its own as you jump and climb on stuff. Meaning, in some scenarios, if you want to just move forward and you're just pointing the joystick up, Ezio will not go forward. The solution is to recognize areas where navigation is more wonky, and make sure you locate Ezio and the camera to where you want him to go. Sounds easy, but this does break the flow of what is supposed to be a smooth and badass looking movement system.

Combat can also be pretty frustrating at times. Once again, the game sometimes behaves in unexpected ways. Target locking, camera, and Ezio's ability to hit an enemy standing literally in front of him are not always as functional as you'd expect them to be. But, when the combat works, it becomes way too easy, once you get a kill, you can sweep through an entire group of enemies. You can also recruit junior assassins and have them kill whoever you don't feel like killing yourself, which is pretty funny.

While Ezio's story is perfectly servicable, the bits of Desmond's scenes you get are nothing to write home about. There's lots of banter which is not funny at all and the whiny guy becomes annoying real fast. Finally, the general gameplay is good. There is enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Eventually I felt like I got as much from the game as I could, and finished the main story without completing, probably, around half of the open world content.

Overall, Brotherhood was a fine enough action-adventure game and I'm sure I'll get to the next game, eventually."
user_76561198081528316,"The added game mechanics are a nice addition and make the gameplay way more more exciting than AC2. It feels way more polished but I still manage to encounter some bugs like falling through the map. The final fight was awful. The fighting gets quite repetitive in general after a couple of hours but is still more engaging than AC1 and AC2 and I believe it very much fits the flow of the game. I am a fan of the parkour which feels more polished, even though there a multiple instances where it feels very restricted, like the game clearly tells you what path to climb the monument from, which I don't like. 

The church at the very ending of the game is one of the most beautiful game areas I've ever seen.

All in all this is definitely still one of the Assassin's Creed which is worth to play, simply for the parkour and story. (7.8/10)"

user_76561199163560497,"Was just about to give it 8/10 or even 9/10 as for the most part it did its job, and did it fairly well, but...

Mechanics are almost like in AC2, couple new additions like parachute, poison darts, assassins you can call, etc., but not much else to consider it a completely new game. Don't get me wrong, those things worked, I had an absolute blast sending recruits on missions, liberating towers that explode as Ezio jumps down from them, even hunting treasures and doing side missions (except for Romulus guys, skipped that part almost entirely). Guild challanges are more or less enjoyable, investing in merchants felt quite good, restoration, Rome economy stuff and small aqueduct ""puzzles"" all felt right. But that's basically it: slightly upgraded AC2.
Graphics and voice acting are decent, plot is more or less engaging (but of course Animus parts are much more captivating, real world parts are okay-ish).

And then sequence 8 started... with apple and absolutely rushed ending, where you chase Cesare in some linear setting with ""desynchronization walls"" to the sides (since when did AC become a ""hallway action"" type of game?).
Mechanics of fighting with apple are not only unintuitive, and seemingly capable of hurting allies, you also can't opt out of it. Why oh why did I spend whole game gathering my whole weapons setup and then am forced to fight without it?

Last several hours were completely awful for me here.
FInal verdict: good to play as a continuation of AC2, but don't see much replayability on its own.
Oh yeah, and Christina sequences revealed a frustrating side of Ezio's character, no idea why they made it like that.

ACB is the same as the previous one, with little new to offer. This means that the game is good, but replayability, enjoyment, and the desire to complete it thoroughly are less. 
The crossbow was a nice addition, but Roma is very dull. There is too much text about the environment, and everything is disconnected, so there is no incentive (not even intellectual) to read it. 
The story seems forced, you don't even get to ""hate"" the villains, the ending is rushed through time as it was with ACII, and there is too much to do for nothing, so the only incentive to collect everything or do the guild quest is to silence the obsessive completionist within you.
In addition, the 50% notification is annoying, it's like telling you you didn't do things right when the challenges are random things that do not make the progress more entertaining. Half the time, I failed the 100% due to the game's fault. Like, I can walk in front of a soldier and disappear and he will forget me, but one second more before killing him (hidden from the sight of any other) counts as seen, and the time window is inconsistent. 
This felt as if it could have been half a game, not a full entry."
user_76561199005530488,"Brotherhood is slow in parts, and perhaps slightly too large for its own good. Yet, overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. I liked the actual namesake part of the game of building up a Brotherhood/goon squad to help you out. While a bit of a slow burn at times, the story was pretty good."
user_76561199041931529,"So many bugs and glitches and the login is terrible. I have to put in a password every time just to play the game. When I try to stream it or record it I have a black screen. You can't save like a normal game, there are certain things you have to do in game, which is really inconvenient. If you do something out of order, of which you can't tell if you are... you could find yourself in a desynchronization circle, and because there are no save points, you can't go back to certain cinamatics and replay the story. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless they are really patient, or they fix the bugs."
user_76561198013056652,"I had to buy this a second time because UPLAY was an evil idea... but... that's a testament to how good this one was. I've been wanting to get back into this, I just haven't found the time.

This one just has one of the best environments, and some of the coolest gameplay features. Also, it really goes pretty hard with it's villain. It suffers a little from a political bias, but not so much that makes me feel like calling it out on it's history.

I think this one, it's kinda pinnacle of classic AC gameplay, environment, level design, and... I don't wanna say the story, but it's probably got the best performances from it's cast.

There's more emotional stories, there's less political stories, there's more innovative gameplay, there's bigger environments, there's others with more customization... but this one is probably the last time AC was just practically almost infallible... with the exception of uplay. 

If you're a fan of the franchise this is one of the best, and maybe the best. Easy top 3 for me, somewhere with unity and Odyssey."
user_76561198045361192,"Very solid entry to the series.  Good story, great character in Ezio, not much else to say, if you like the Assassin Creed games, the chances you will like this are high.  The combat has improved since AC2 at least which makes it more streamlined, but it still isn't perfect yet at this point in the franchise.  Just get it, it's probably cheap as hell here on Steam with a sale so stop crying and put it in your cart.  Like right now it's on sale for $5 US, so if you can't afford that or that is too much money for you then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games."

user_76561199070428983,"Main story is super bad. But, the game have a lot of side content that's actually good. But, seriously Main Story has a lot of padding. It's a shame coming to this game immediately after AC2, where the story and characters have such a memorable writing to them."

user_76561198411074866,"The Game is 14 years old. ubisoft could fix all the bugs there ever existed in this game. They have resources for  it. They still want 15 f Euros or 20 f bucks for it. And what do you get for it?

1. lot of bugs: i literally have to play with opened web browser to google this sh*t and hope some reddit users solved this for me. (to be exact: missions ""Flying Machine 2.0"" and ""Pax Romana"" are barely playable due to the bugs)
2. no ""borderless window""  mode. Every switching between game and any other app last 5 seconds at least and you can't use your second screed if you have it. That means you better place your laptop nearby. 
3. annoying unskippable animations.
4. controls are just sh*t. When you're in battle, targets can switch for no reason. You're trying to attack npc, then next attack goes in other direction just because the game have decided to do so.
5. menus: in some menus you should use enter to proceed, in others you should use space. Looks like there were different developer teams, which were not really communicating between each other. Also in some menus you can't use escape button to exit... for no f reason.
6. "" synchronization"" mechanic (complete the mission with some additional condition) is pure sh*t. Only people with no personal life will complete it.
7. Boring and monotonous task such as ""clear this area"", ""loot all chests over huge area"" and ""collect 10 items which you get randomly from random places"". Merchant quests are pure sh*t.
8. on top of everything from above you get problems with ""ubisoft connect"" - useless piece of sh*t. Like ""oh we can't connect to our own server... pls do restart your pc"". People do some crap to make this sh*t work. (On reddit people share their stories as they change their password and log out on their phones to make ""ubisoft connect"" work) (and they sell games there for 60 f euro!!! I'm not kidding!!!)

As the result i want to make a personal statement:
I HATE uBISOFT. I personally think they are greedy, lazy, incompetent snails

Compare yourself:
They want 40 euro for AC Black Flag (do you even know/remember this game?), while at the same time Skyrim SE costs same 40 euros!!!

(You can get Skyrim SE for 8 euro on discount on Steam, while the lowest price for AC Black Flag is 12!!!)



I can't complete the game, since i can't make the character to move in right direction in ""Pax Romana"" mission. And i'm not sure they'll return me my money."

user_76561197971172816,"[h1]A respectable sequel to Assassin’s Creed 2, with some glaring flaws and frustrations that hold it back from greatness.[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was originally meant be to be an AC2 DLC rather than a full-fledged game. In some ways you can’t tell. In other ways, you absolutely can. It’s large, it’s ambitious, Rome is incredibly impressive, the game adds all sorts of new game mechanics, and even the graphics are noticeably upgraded. This is a full, well-realized game that stands on its own. Where it’s lacking is some of the forethought and decision-making that went into writing, pacing, and realizing this world.

[B]Positives:[/B]

[B]+[/B] AC:B has the best Desmond content yet, bar none.
[B]+[/B] Visuals are noticeably improved over AC1 & 2, with better lighting and textures.
[B]+[/B] Combat is significantly improved. The animations, the kick, and general combat felt a lot more fun than in AC2. Combat for once feels proactive rather than just reactive.
[B]+[/B] Fewer villains and side characters, with more focus on them and their character development. The interactions and cutscenes involving Cesare, Rodrigo, and Lucrezia were a real highlight.
[B]+[/B] The recruiting system was a nice addition, and sending out assassins was fun.
[B]+[/B] The real world structures were beautifully done, including the Colosseum, Castel Sant’Angelo and the aqueducts. 

[B]Negatives:[/B]

[B]-[/B] Pacing is a mess, especially the end of the game, which came out of nowhere and then proceeded to go through a bunch of disjointed sequences that left my head spinning. The game is only 9 sequences, compared to the 13 in AC2. There's too much side content. AC2 strikes a nice balance between the campaign and side content. They flowed together. AC:B only has about 15 hours of main story and then 30 hours of side content.
[B]-[/B] Rome didn’t feel as well utilized as AC2’s cities. Too much open space and landscape traversal was often a pain. Parkour took a backseat in this game, which was disappointing. Roman ruins are a pain to navigate. The parkour system frequently wasn’t smart enough to traverse pillars. It often messed up understanding my intent, which led to a lot of me yelling at the game. The Quick Travel system was also more effort than it was worth.
[B]-[/B] Uneven mission difficulty, especially thanks to all the stealth missions. Stealth was incredibly frustrating and led to a lot of cursing at the screen. The tailing missions were excessive, you often had to follow an invisible path, and you’d instantly fail if you deviated at all. It was frustrating guesswork rather than skill.
[B]-[/B] Courtesan/Thief/Assassin missions were fun occasionally, but there were too many and they weren’t well integrated. I had to go do them all after having finished the game. Also, the Truth Glyphs felt like an afterthought. As did weapons upgrades, art, shop upgrades, and races. Lots of things that carried over from AC2 felt a bit half-assed here, just thrown in to artificially inflate the play time. The Tiber hideout felt like a big step down from the AC2 Villa.
[B]-[/B] Music was good, but a step down from AC1/2. Less memorable.
[B]-[/B] Borgia Towers were annoying. Failing a mission because the target happened to get away, and then having to wait for the day/night cycle for him to return – was frustrating. Additionally, climbing the towers was a lot more difficult than in AC2, and not in a good way.
[B]-[/B] The 50% sync mechanic is HORRIBLE. It both creates FOMO and forces you to finish missions in a certain way, which is a no-no for an open world game. Failing to get 100% over some stupid reason was infuriating. This mechanic is the single worst part of AC:B.


----------

I finished the game in 30:32 in-game time (46.7 hrs in Steam) for 86.63%. That includes every mission, viewpoint, treasure, Rome flag, feather, Borgia tower, Truth Glyph and DLC content. The lack of 100% is due to that horrible 50% sync mechanic. I had no desire to retry these missions for 100%. I also missed 5/18 crypt flags, which I have no incentive to go back for.

----------


[B]This review has a lot more negatives listed than positives, but it’s still a very good game. The issue is that for every step forward it took from AC2, it took two steps backwards, which resulted in an end product that felt rushed and incomplete. The bones of a great game are there, and a lot of work was put into some great new ideas that were a genuine upgrade from AC2 – ideas like the combat mechanics, certain side missions, and the entire assassin recruiting system. With some more planning and another 6 months in the oven, AC:B could have been a truly great game, just as AC2 was. But as it stands, the game has too many half-measures and too much frustration to be on AC2’s level.[/B]

[B]8.2/10[/B]

 Might as well get on sale if you want more AC2."

user_76561199098876277,"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the real Assassin's Creed III, is still a sequel. It still has the same elements as its predecessor but with minor graphical improvement, establishing a brotherhood and leveling up assassins, buying stores, and finding the mysteries of Roma. It's really interesting and keeps the series going alive and well. You can love Ezio Auditore more. Is the story better than II or I? Well, it has the same elements as II in storytelling due to a lot of political and superhero savings you have to do that makes sense in the context of this game. Does it have programming issues? Barely. It really depends on how CPUs react. However, in the near end, I was stuck in a neverending loop and the boss was stuttering and cannot hit them to progress the game so I had to restart the whole memory over. However, this is an awesome game still. 88%."

user_76561198148543029,"Playing this game right after finishing Assassin’s Creed 2 which made me have high expectations for Brotherhood, and it delivered the high expectations and to be honest not as much as Assassin’s Creed 2 that I was hoped for. I Still have Revelations to finish, and I can't wait to see what it will happen since it was my first time playing Assassin’s Creed games, and I was spoiler free too! 

• Graphics were an improvement to Assassin's Creed 2 and the game looked much better, the textures were as the game it is ... old, but they were more detailed and sharper [spoiler] Some textures looked better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and for a 2010 game in my opinion it looks younger sometimes even better than some tipple A game released from the same company now 
[spoiler] For real now have you seen the new Star Wars outlaws gameplay ? Even PS3 games look better than that (Game was nor released at the time of this review) [/spoiler] but in personally I had a bug (Not sure if it is like that for everybody) my camera was foggy in the top part until I moved the camera POV from top view to bottom view. 
• Gameplay to be honest is almost identical to Assassin’s Creed 2 the single differences are the new mechanic when you hit a combo and one shoot some of the enemies and  [spoiler] Now the game says what keys due to the actions instead of a random emote [/spoiler] but everything felt the same, combat identical (except the combo thing), parkour identical in my opinion did not felt any difference and the animations felt the same witch [spoiler] You guessed it, is better than Valhalla [/spoiler] and the new thing they added in Brotherhood [spoiler] you can save people from a fight and convert them to assassins  [/spoiler]. 
• Story Unfortunately for me was not as good as Assassin’s Creed 2, but it was one of the good ones, and now I can understand why so many people said ""Ezio is my favorite assassin"" it is an extremely likeable character. Some moments from the story to be honest felt heartbreaking when [spoiler] Villa is attacked by Cesare and in that mission ... HE KILLED MARIO for real, I loved that guy, WHY ??? [/spoiler]. And I want to include it there at the end when [spoiler] You fight Cesare on the castle wall [/spoiler] I had a bug from the refresh rate (Had the game at 1440p 165fps Vsync On) and it didn't enter on the cutscene I manage to fix it by changing the refresh rate to 60 in game and [spoiler] Jump of the castle wall [/spoiler] to restart the mission. 

In my opinion, this game deserves a 7 out of 10 it wasn't as good as AC2 in my opinion, I got that game at summer sale 2023 for 4.5 euro and I managed to finish the game in 12 hours Unfortunately you need to activate it on Uplay even if you got it on steam (Since Ubisoft policy of ""Get Comfortable With Not Owning Games"" I can't recommend getting it anywhere else except from steam or Jack Sparrow way)"
user_76561199021227272,"It's kind of fun, not as good as AC2. I'm 32 hours in and still in memory 5 OMG this game gets soooo boring it drags so much. Also Ubish*t Connect and no cloud saves :S. I wish my Steam Purchased games didn't have to use an extra launcher. Steam has better DRM and cloud saves, making it so much better for portable gaming.

I hope Steam could broker a deal to get rid of all those extra launchers and enable cloud saves for people who uses a Steam Deck."

[b][i] “Nós trabalhamos no escuro para servir a luz. Nós somos assassinos. Nada é verdade, tudo é permitido.” [/i][/b]

Com o sucesso estrondoso de [b][i] Assassin's Creed 2, [/i][/b] uma sequência à altura era inevitável, trazendo mais aventuras com o nosso querido italiano, Ezio Auditore. [b][i] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood [/i][/b] surge para apresentar um Ezio mais maduro, com novas ambições, aliados e planos.

[h1] Sinopse: [/h1]

Assim como nos jogos anteriores, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood começa sem interrupções, continuando diretamente do ponto onde Assassin's Creed 2 terminou. 

Após as revelações sobre o passado, presente e futuro, Ezio se vê forçado a embarcar em uma nova missão, acreditando já ter concluído sua busca por vingança. Porém, ao retornar para Roma, ele descobre que a luta contra a poderosa família Bórgia está longe de acabar.

Com a cidade dominada pela corrupção e o caos, Ezio precisará formar uma irmandade de Assassinos para restaurar a liberdade e enfrentar inimigos cada vez mais formidáveis.

[h1] Jogabilidade: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood traz um salto significativo em termos de jogabilidade ao introduzir novos elementos que complementam a fórmula já estabelecida em Assassin's Creed 2. A principal adição é o sistema de recrutamento e treinamento de Assassinos, que permite a Ezio recrutar aliados pela cidade de Roma. Esses novos aliados podem ser chamados a qualquer momento durante o combate ou missões, criando um sentimento de liderança e estratégia que não existia nos jogos anteriores.

Além disso, o sistema de combate foi refinado, oferecendo mais fluidez nas sequências de ataques e contra-ataques. Agora, Ezio pode engajar múltiplos oponentes de forma mais eficiente, e o uso de execuções em cadeia permite uma abordagem mais agressiva, tornando o combate mais dinâmico e gratificante.

[b][u] Combate: [/u][/b] 

O combate em Brotherhood evolui de forma significativa em relação ao seu antecessor. A maior novidade é a possibilidade de usar seus recrutas durante lutas, permitindo que Ezio combata com ainda mais táticas. A introdução de uma roda de comandos torna o gerenciamento desses assassinos simples e estratégico, permitindo enviar ordens para eliminar guardas ou desarmar armadilhas à distância.

Além disso, Ezio conta com novas armas, como a besta, que oferece uma abordagem furtiva de longa distância, e venenos mais avançados que afetam de maneira mais caótica os inimigos. A fluidez do combate corpo a corpo também foi aprimorada, com novos movimentos de finalização que trazem um toque cinematográfico às batalhas.

[b][u] Furtividade: [/u][/b] 

A furtividade continua a ser um pilar fundamental do jogo, mas agora com mais opções estratégicas. O sistema de notoriedade retorna, mas foi aprimorado para oferecer uma experiência mais desafiadora. Agora, as ações de Ezio têm consequências mais visíveis na cidade de Roma, e a remoção de cartazes ou o suborno de oficiais se torna ainda mais crucial para manter-se despercebido.

Outro destaque é o uso de seus recrutas. Com a irmandade de Assassinos ao seu lado, Ezio pode planejar ataques coordenados para eliminar alvos sem precisar sujar as próprias mãos, aumentando as possibilidades de abordagem furtiva.

[h1] Arsenal: [/h1]

O arsenal de Ezio foi expandido com uma série de novas armas e equipamentos que complementam sua versatilidade em combate e furtividade. A besta, em particular, se destaca como uma arma letal e silenciosa, perfeita para eliminar guardas à distância sem alertar os demais.

As lâminas duplas retornam, permitindo que Ezio realize assassinatos simultâneos com maior facilidade. Novos venenos, como o veneno berserk, fazem com que os inimigos enlouqueçam e ataquem seus próprios companheiros, criando caos sem que Ezio precise se envolver diretamente.

As armaduras também seguem o mesmo padrão do jogo anterior, com melhorias visuais e funcionais à medida que você avança, tornando Ezio ainda mais resistente em combate.

[h1] Gráficos: [/h1]

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood não traz um salto gráfico tão grande, mas compensa com uma atenção aos detalhes no design da cidade de Roma. A escala da cidade é impressionante, e cada distrito tem uma identidade única, desde as áreas mais nobres até os bairros mais pobres e dominados pela criminalidade.

A iluminação e os efeitos climáticos contribuem para a imersão, com pores do sol deslumbrantes refletindo nas construções históricas e a arquitetura renascentista sendo fielmente representada. Os modelos de personagens também receberam um polimento, com expressões faciais mais detalhadas, especialmente em Ezio e seus aliados.

[h1] Trilha Sonora: [/h1]

A trilha sonora, mais uma vez composta por Jesper Kyd, complementa perfeitamente o tom do jogo. As composições são ricas em elementos que evocam tanto a grandiosidade de Roma quanto os momentos mais pessoais e introspectivos da jornada de Ezio.

A música se adapta de maneira eficaz às situações de alta tensão e combate, ao mesmo tempo que sabe ser sutil nas cenas mais emocionais, como quando Ezio interage com seus aliados ou enfrenta momentos de perda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkUfTArwlS4

[h1] Veredito: [/h1]

[b] Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood mantém a excelência de seu antecessor, ampliando a fórmula com novas mecânicas e uma narrativa envolvente. A introdução da irmandade de Assassinos oferece uma camada extra de estratégia, enquanto as melhorias no combate e nas opções de furtividade tornam a experiência ainda mais variada e divertida. 

Com gráficos imersivos e uma trilha sonora memorável, Brotherhood é uma sequência digna de sua posição na trilogia de Ezio, proporcionando uma experiência completa de aventura, vingança e liderança. Para os fãs da franquia, este título é imperdível. [/b]

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
user_76561198169133553,"Basically just more of AC2. If you liked that, get this.

It does introduce some new things though, so I will list what's cool and sucks:

Cool:
The main gimmick of brotherhood is that you can recruit assassins who you can call in at any time, they can jump in during a fight, stealthily pick off a guard or two, and even do a kill-everyone move where they rain down arrows.

You can also send them on missions and level them up. Your minions can also die permanently if you're reckless with them; sending them on high-risk missions or if they get killed while jumping in to fight with you.

You can carry heavy weapons with you instead of temporarily picking them off a dead enemy, you also have way more ranged options as well; ranged poison darts, a crossbow or even just calling in an assassin to kill a dude while you watch from a distance.

If you kill one enemy you can immediately execute another in a murder chain, kind of makes the combat too easy but really fun to do.

Lame stuff:

The story is pretty lame, it has a lot of classic ubisoft padding and as a result the game feels bloated at times, Ezio is a great protagonist but his character arc was nicely concluded by the end of the previous game, so there's not much room for development.

Unlike in AC2, there's only one area the game takes place in (except for a few small ones used for specific missions), which is rome. As cool as it sounds it gets samey quickly with how all the streets look the same. AC2 did a good job of making each area feel different, you had the standard city of florence, the aquatic but elegant venice, the wetlands of forli, and the big green fields of tuscany.

I overall prefer how AC2 had multiple smaller areas, instead of one big city with various districts.

Brotherhood also has a lot of pointless mechanics like all the shops in a district being closed until you kill the big bad borgia lieutenant in his tower, but not only that you ALSO have to pay to open the shop, which you THEN pay to shop from?


Tl;dr: If you liked assassin's creed 2 and the character of ezio then play this, but if not you're better off skipping to assassin's creed 3."
user_76561198107472488,"Late in this games story, Niccolo Machiavelli tells Ezio that he intends to write a book summarizing his great deeds. Ezio asks him to keep it short.
Machiavelli did not listen.
This game is too damn long for a story that really started losing its wind halfway through the previous game. Don't get me wrong, I think there is a good overarching story here, and I wish I could maintain my interest in it, but this game is where they just started giving you more and more and more and more bullshit to do. More missions, more sidequests, more distractions. Even if all of it was good (and a lot of it is mostly just kind of meh, especially the sidequests) there's so much of it that by the final third of my playthrough I was groaning any time I'd be given some bullshit mission that clearly wasn't going to be the climactic end, mashing X repeatedly while asking ""are we seriously still here?"" And if you just want to focus on a specific kind of sidequest, you will be arbitrarily told throughout almost the entire game ""No, you can't go there yet,"" so everything, regardless of how interested in it you are, is drip fed to you painfully slowly. I stopped caring about the questline about Ezios old love-life because I wasn't given those missions in a timely fashion. I stopped trying to decode the secrets because they were being hidden in larger and larger buildings that were a chore to climb (I don't know if it was a glitch, or another example of being arbitrarily told ""no, not yet,"" but the Colosseum glyph just straight up never showed up for me). I never got the armor from the Romulus temples even though I only had one more to go, because by that point I was so thoroughly done with this game that the thought of doing more for a set of armor that I wasn't going to need made me nauseous. If the intention is for you to do this after you complete the main story, which is already way too long, I ask: why would I bother?
Which really sucks because there is actually a lot of good here. The parkour has progressed quite well, even if Ezio does infuriatingly come to a halt when ever you want to descend or climb the edge of a surface, you can actually use a controller without having to install third-party software that might not work, and the combat, though certainly way too easy, is flashy enough to where I really don't mind it. It's really cool watching Ezio eviscerate enemies with ease, even if you don't really have to do much to accomplish that.
Though I was harping on the story, it's really not too bad as a whole, it's just too long, is all. Characters would just plop into the story for you to save or assassinate and then disappear from the plot just as easily as they had come in. Though it's hardly developed, I kind of liked seeing Ezio starting to face the fact that he's aging, and seeing him put more trust in his family and friends. Even though the plot of this game is kicked off by Ezio doing something unnecessarily stupid in the end of the last game (seriously, just fucking kill the guy you were sent to kill, it's your fucking job), I find Cesare Borgia to actually be the closest to an interesting villain that this series has had since the first game, though I think this is largely because Andreas Apergis' wonderful performance (really I would say that all of the cast did an excellent job, Andreas just really takes the cake.) 
But at the end of the day, both the plot and extra-curricular activities all have way too much bloat with too much time focused on the fat and not enough development of the meat to say that I walked away enjoying the overall experience. It was so bad that, even though technically big things were happening by the end of the game, I was using cutscenes as an excuse to do other stuff around the house while they played out, half paying attention while I organized my bookshelf or whatever.
I could recommend this game, it's the first in the series that I would say holds up to today, feeling like how the second game felt to me in my youth, but I would say don't fret about any of the side content, as the main content may not even really feel worth it in the end.
Also RIP in peas this games bitchin' multiplayer."
user_76561199041622090,"Note: I’ll base this review on a comparison with previous games in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. I updated this review after completing almost all missions (+86% sync.). It doesn’t make sense for me to aim for 100% completion when there are no rewards or, more importantly, meaningful interactions or lore.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]Thematic Elements: The thematic elements in the game are good, blending real-world history with fiction (something common in many Assassin’s Creed games).
    [*]NPCs: The NPCs and Its costumes are better developed than in previous games.
    [*]Map Markers: Map markers for secondary objectives (such as feathers, flags..) are really appreciated.
    [*]Good effects in some NPCs (especially those with fire effects) and certain scenes.
    [*]Lore: Despite occasional inaccuracies or questionable details, I still appreciate the game’s lore.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]Bugs (Sequence 9 and Leonardo's Flying Machine): To prevent this issue, changing the video resolution to 1920x1080 at 60Hz and enabling V-Sync worked. If you’re in the middle of Sequence 9, you can apply the changes, exit the Animus, and re-enter, still having completed the secondary quest. Then, when climbing the tower, avoid fighting the guards and go directly to pursue Cesare.
    [*]Horse Mechanics: The horse mechanics are horrific. It takes too long to call the horse, and it always stops 10 meters away from you. The sprint feels useless in open areas and tedious in close streets. It becomes tedious and confusing.
    [*]PC: The computer messages are confusing (especially in late-game). There are no markers to indicate read or unread messages.
    [*]ANIMUS: I don’t think it’s a good idea that you can’t leave the Animus after beating the game. If you want to complete 100% and experience as many interactions as possible, think twice before starting Sequence 9 [spoiler](which begins with obtaining the fruit from the big golden egg)[/spoiler]. Also, interactions outside the Animus are rich in the early game but poor in the late game.
[/olist]

Additional Observations:
[olist]
    [*]Story: If it weren’t for the fact that this game is part of [spoiler] Desmond’s story [/spoiler] and combines real-world and fictional elements, there wouldn’t be much to highlight. It feels like [spoiler] (and indeed is) [/spoiler] a complementary game with a strong thematic backdrop, designed to continue the franchise. Personally, I found more enjoyment in the secondary missions such as [spoiler]Rosa in Fiore and Ezio and Cristina missions[/spoiler] than in the main game itself.
    [*]Game Mechanics: [u]I’m not sure if it’s due to my lack of experience[/u], but I believe some mechanics are flawed (notably, the training process feels unusually challenging and non-intuitive):
    [list]
    [*]The jump direction isn’t well-executed.
    [*]The killstreak mechanic with some weapons, particularly when using the pistol to finish off [u]an already dead enemy[/u] becomes inconvenient, especially when you're surrounded by more than four enemies (whom you can’t block, so dodging is your only option) and need bullets.
    [*]Stealing interactions bored me a bit and left me unengaged.
    [/list]    
    [*]Exploration: It remains unclear when certain zones unlock, leading to periodic checks to see if they’re accessible. This can indeed be a time-consuming endeavor. Additionally You can complete the entire game without pursuing any secondary objectives, collecting feathers, or engaging in other optional activities. While some players might appreciate this freedom, I prefer more structured completion goals.
    [*]The Portals: The inclusion of portals on the map is an excellent touch, enhancing the overall experience. However, the lack of secondary-quest and store markers are a mistake.
    [*]Interactions: Upon completing or collecting secondary missions and objectives, I expected meaningful interactions. Unfortunately, there was nothing remarkable.
[/olist]

[u] Conclussion: [/u]
I still recommend this game, However, I can’t rate it higher than [b]6 out of 10[/b]. It feels like [spoiler](and actually is)[/spoiler] a middle-of-the-road game. The story isn’t entirely well-crafted; it’s better than the second-game but not as good as the first.
The only thing that elevates my rating for this game to a 6 out of 10 (matching what I gave the first game in the franchise) is the [spoiler] unexpected and impressive ending. [/spoiler]
I left out many details, such as the [spoiler]Assassin’s group[/spoiler] and other aspects, but I highlighted what had the most impact on me.
[b]If you’re pressed for time, I suggest going directly to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. It’s one of the gems in the franchise.[/b]"

user_76561198431358246,"     Oh yeah! This is it! This is the one that so many people say is the best of the best! Well, color me surprised because it was not exactly like that for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still good, but I would be lying to say that it was anywhere near as good as AC2.

     In case you are running short on time, I would give this game a... [h2] 7/10 [/h2]
But if you have time to kill then I'll explain to you why I would consider this game to be an overall step down from the prior entry:

     Ok, to start things off this is the first game in the series that requires you to make a Ubisoft Connect account. I too found this to be annoying when I set it up, but once you get the hang of it, it is not that difficult to work with. Just remember to write your password down somewhere convenient since I'm pretty sure that it asks you to type it in every time you click on the game.

     Now for the review...

     Basically everything in this game comes with a ""but"". For starters, the city of Rome is a decent enough setting for the game. The city is massive, dense, and has plenty of side quests and collectibles to find... but I still feel like the game could've used at least one more city or town to add some variety to the world. It just feels more claustrophobic that AC2. On top of that, only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the city is actually filled up with buildings. This does allow for horses to be ridden on the city streets which is nice... but it also makes the city feel empty, almost like it is a husk of a greater city that came before. Now that I think about it, an Assassins Creed game set inside a Roman-Republic era Italy would be pretty sweet.

     The characters are another mixed bag for me. Ezio retains his charm from AC2, and to the game's credit it does improve some of the characters from the previous game, most notably Christina and the soldier guy. We are also introduced to a couple of new characters, mainly the two children of Rodrigo Borgia. These two have incredible voice acting and are delightfully dramatic... BUT they aren't the most interesting characters. Cesare in particular is set up as being this evil monster who is willing to do anything to unite Italy, but the game doesn't give him enough time to act evil for it to seem believable or compelling. The big issue I have with the characters in this game is how the game doesn't always utilize them to their full potential, or it doesn't use them very much at all. One of the best examples of this is Caterina, who was seemingly being set up as Ezio's romantic partner. But after Ezio helps her escape from a place, she just leaves the game and doesn't show up again, which was a real shame considering how much of a badass she was in AC2. Bottom line is that the characters have issues.

     The fighting in this game is the first in the series to feel too easy. The main reason that I say this is due to the introduction of kill streaking. Essentially it works by blocking and countering an enemy attack, after which Ezio will enter a state in which he will continue to instantly kill enemies unless he either gets hit or cannot reach an enemy in the next couple of seconds. This is a really cool feature... BUT!!!... it follows into another issue that I have with the combat. You see, when you couple the instant kill feature with the fact that Ezio has a chance of killing an enemy with a random normal strike, you create a game that nullifies the whole healthbar system that was created in the the second game and made it so much fun. This is a bit of a nitpick since the combat in this game is pretty good, especially with the new brutal kill animations that this game introduces.

     Most of the side content in this game is good... and that is that. Honestly, I praise this game for having so much additional features outside the main story. Honestly, the restored memories provide a secondary story that might be even better than the main one... I really mean that. Which brings me to my main issue with this game... The Story. Ooftah.

     The story in this game is... just so disappointing. Like, it's painfully obvious that this game was created with it's main focus on the extensive side content and missions. Now, this is more of my opinion than an objective fact, but I would rather have a game that focuses mainly on it's story and less on it's side content rather than the other way around. I found the story in this game to be a little confusing at times, but while in previous games I was able to piece together anything that I did not understand and still get something great out of it, in this one it felt as if something big was missing from the story. On top of the confusion I felt, the story felt too short, slow at times, and by the time it was over it almost felt like nothing had happened at all, which is crazy since a lot of really important things did happen. In it's credit the story does make a couple of creative decisions that I think are perfectly executed, especially the creative way that Ezio looses all of his Assassin equipment.

     Finally, contrary to it's name, the game has very little to do with forming an assassin brotherhood of Rome. It is essential for a couple of missions, but putting aside a mission system for your recruits and the mechanic that allows you to call them in to help in a fight, their presence in this game is kind of small.

     So yeah, this game was a clear step down from the second one if you ask me. Don't get me wrong I still like it and may even play it again some time... but that does not negate the fact that this game feels off in several ways and is an overall decline in quality from AC2. In the end all I can say is... please, please, please don't screw up Assassins Creed Revelations."
