user_76561198048565866,"After 11 years of rampant cheating, they decided to add an anti cheat yesterday. 
They picked on that is not compatible with linux, unless they literally check a box, which they did not do and said they will not do. So all linux users, including all steam decks, now cant play the game. just straight up locked out. I will be trying to get my money back, and you'll never catch me giving Rockstar money ever again. This is the last straw for me. I do not reccoment this game, or red dead, or gta 6. This company will cheat you out of every cent they can."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out."
user_76561199746810111,"DO NOT BUY ON STEAM! Rockstar has disabled GTA Online for Steam Deck players. BattleEye IS compatible with Steam Deck, Rockstar is just CHOOSING to cut us off!  I will never trust a Rockstar game ever again.  Trash company."
user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."
user_76561198030341881,GTAV online is ruined by modding. My character was artificially leveled and i was given a bunch of achievements within a second. I still have fun in invite only servers with my friends
user_76561198060191168,"Rockstar does it again. Understand that the people that work there are a bunch of azzgoblins hellbent on making you have the worst experience possible until you eventually hate GTAO and quit playing it, or at least quit playing it. 
In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I am so glad I never bought Red Dead Redemtion2 and I will never get GTA6. You probably shouldn't either."
user_76561199083523510,"What the actual f..... My account earned a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe and for what?... Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people."
user_76561198096706151,"Game is fun, but can't be played by linux or steam deck users now. Modders will be back in a week but linux players won't. Refund the game under Steam Play Issues if you are a linux user."
user_76561198057571351,"New lovely thing happening where battleye constantly requires an update and kicks me out of GTA ONLINE after I complete a job. I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD. These developers need to get their shit together or im just gonna be one of the many people who dont pre order or buy GTA 6. Developers, you have our trust, DONT LOSE IT"
user_76561198093798262,"- Implemented anti cheat after a decade and picked the worst one to do it
- Linux support went to shit for online mode
- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561198106848097,"Shafted Linux Support and blamed the Steam Deck for not supporting the Anti-Cheat when Proton supports it, they blamed Steam Deck because they could not be asked to request to BattlEye to enable Linux Support, it's not that difficult, Rockstar!

After being mistreated, blocked from fixing my contact details, my username, not even letting me migrate my PS4 character to PC, or anything like that, I am done, I'm deleting this game and going elsewhere. Screw you Rockstar! >:("
user_76561198080889048,"The devs are willing to put in the work to implement BattlEye but not the work to ensure it works with Linux.
For anyone that owns a Steam Deck - this game no longer works if you want to play it online."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."
user_76561199095755744,"Broskis really added an anti-cheat to a 9 years old game, and even though the anti-cheat has full support for Linux, and requires NO effort on the developers to add it, they refuse to support Linux. I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

"
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.
user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

On top of that, it was bypassed shortly after it's inclusion making it utterly worthless. Now it effectively serves only to bar innocent users from playing what they paid for."
user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198203790740,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198079843918,"kernel level anticheat is not necessary
  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

With the new Anti-cheat system

user_76561198057401282,"Imagine adding malware to your game years after launch and cutting off a portion of your players because said malware doesn't work on certain operating systems.

Rockstar is an absolutely pathetic scam of a company and frankly, this type of behavior should result in games being removed from Steam. I bought this game without the extra malware and to have it added after the fact is ridiculous at all, but especially so when it actively results in the removal of peoples ability to play."
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198062940970,"A game which has been in an atrocious state cheating wise since launch got an update to add anti cheat, yet the anti cheat locks out Steam Deck/Linux users making GTAO unplayable.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game. I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

Shame on you, Rockstar!"

I don’t, however, love Rockstar games. My only gaming device is a Steam Deck, and they decided to rip this game away from the Steam Deck community rather than spend a little extra time confirming the compatibility with Proton.

Honestly really disappointed in Rockstar, but not surprised."

user_76561199345488374,After working for so long. Rockstar and their great wisdom decided to kill linux support. I am assuming windows is going around paying off these companies to try and kill valve and linux. I guess rockstar just wont be getting anymore of my money.
user_76561198069493994,"For years GTA V (and by extension its built-in online play) under Linux has worked more or less perfectly with Take2 and R* having to do nothing except provide the Windows binaries of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.
user_76561198203790740,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

On top of that, it was bypassed shortly after it's inclusion making it utterly worthless. Now it effectively serves only to bar innocent users from playing what they paid for."
user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198022696711,No longer supports Linux/Steam Deck because they refuse to click a checkbox to enable the support for their new maleware anticheat.
user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

user_76561198239526072,"Removed the ability to play online on Steamdeck and linux randomly with no forwarning, not a great move. and all the modders and cheaters are back anyway so you've accomplished nothing, great job."

user_76561197973528566,"Game is fantastic, but I can't recommend until they fix two major issues. I do not want to install your trash launcher or your trash anit cheat.

user_76561198079843918,"kernel level anticheat is not necessary
  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

With the new Anti-cheat system

they lost a part of their users (linux/steam deck)

user_76561197979843175,"Recently, and without warning, Rock* decided to drop support for Linux players by updating their anti-cheat software. Valve says it is incredibly easy for the developer to fix, but as usual, this has fallen on deaf ears. Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."
user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support. All they needed to do was instruct Battleye that they wanted to support Linux - they failed to do this either intentionally or through incompetence. Either way; I can no longer recommend this game for purchase. Especially after they spent years with a ""Top Played On Steam Deck!"" advertisement."

user_76561198062940970,"A game which has been in an atrocious state cheating wise since launch got an update to add anti cheat, yet the anti cheat locks out Steam Deck/Linux users making GTAO unplayable.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

user_76561198057401282,"Imagine adding malware to your game years after launch and cutting off a portion of your players because said malware doesn't work on certain operating systems.

Rockstar is an absolutely pathetic scam of a company and frankly, this type of behavior should result in games being removed from Steam. I bought this game without the extra malware and to have it added after the fact is ridiculous at all, but especially so when it actively results in the removal of peoples ability to play."
user_76561198056165488,"I mainly play on the Steam Deck with my wife on the computer, so thank you for introducing this absolutely useless update that will solve nothing whatsoever at the expense of locking a number of players out of the game.

May I also add that Battleye is actually supported on Linux, and Rockstar just simply chooses not to enable it."

user_76561197979843175,"Recently, and without warning, Rock* decided to drop support for Linux players by updating their anti-cheat software. Valve says it is incredibly easy for the developer to fix, but as usual, this has fallen on deaf ears. Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."
user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support. All they needed to do was instruct Battleye that they wanted to support Linux - they failed to do this either intentionally or through incompetence. Either way; I can no longer recommend this game for purchase. Especially after they spent years with a ""Top Played On Steam Deck!"" advertisement."

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people."

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

[b]September 2024[/b] - Rockstar finally add an anti-cheat system. It's BattlEye. Hackers immediately use it to control and ruin the experience for others.

Can't wait for new players, old players, MTX whales, and the onslaught of dickheads to migrate to GTA 6.
Eventually GTA6 Online will be the game I pick up once a year for a week or month to have some fun with mates and remember why we left.
Here's to another financially lucrative/creatively bankrupt decade for Take-Two/Rockstar."
user_76561198069493994,"For years GTA V (and by extension its built-in online play) under Linux has worked more or less perfectly with Take2 and R* having to do nothing except provide the Windows binaries of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

Hope the lost sales of GTA VI etc make it worth it since from now on I'm certainly ignoring the existence of anything published by Rockstar Games or Take2 (:"

user_76561198257080570,"Added BattleEye without Linux support, so it's no longer playable on the Steam Deck"
user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.
user_76561198203790740,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

On top of that, it was bypassed shortly after it's inclusion making it utterly worthless. Now it effectively serves only to bar innocent users from playing what they paid for."
user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay. I turned to both supportdesks of Valve and Rockstar and am still not one step further. Blocking Linux for GTA ONline is not nice... Storymode is long finished. Please allow Linux support in Battleye.

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I am so glad I never bought Red Dead Redemtion2 and I will never get GTA6. You probably shouldn't either."
user_76561199083523510,"What the actual f..... My account earned a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe and for what?... Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people."
user_76561198096706151,"Game is fun, but can't be played by linux or steam deck users now. Modders will be back in a week but linux players won't. Refund the game under Steam Play Issues if you are a linux user."

I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198257080570,"Added BattleEye without Linux support, so it's no longer playable on the Steam Deck"
user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

On top of that, it was bypassed shortly after it's inclusion making it utterly worthless. Now it effectively serves only to bar innocent users from playing what they paid for."
user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game. I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

Shame on you, Rockstar!"

Honestly really disappointed in Rockstar, but not surprised."

user_76561198069493994,"For years GTA V (and by extension its built-in online play) under Linux has worked more or less perfectly with Take2 and R* having to do nothing except provide the Windows binaries of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?
user_76561198139132610,"After ten years they finally decided to add an anti cheat.
Yet they chose one of the most limp dick ones possible, fucking battle eye.

They also knowingly chose to not enable steam deck/Linux support too.

Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay.

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198025484300,"Imagine killing a popular 10 year old game for Linux/Steamdeck users entirely just because you are mad that PC players arent getting extorted into buying shark cards to be able to actually play the game at the same rate as console players. 
Not to mention adding kernel level anticheat not months after the largest computer outage in history was caused by a buggy patch to kernel level software."
user_76561198039765694,"Good game, but they broke online support on Linux/Steam deck for no reason. all they have to do is check a single box to make it work and they refuse to. Greedy and shortsighted. It literally worked a month ago just fine and now they took the game away."
user_76561198188869502,I played the Game on Steam Deck. Sadly the Anti-Cheat implementation makes GTA Online unplayable on Linux (and doesnt even fix the cheating).... Please add Steam Deck Support again Rockstar!!!!
user_76561198002450035,"Added a third-party anti-cheat 9 years after release which disables online play for all Linux and subsequently Steam Deck users, wonder if I can get a refund."
user_76561199765579053,"Game is immmersive and fun but only if you play in private invite only session with friends,avoid public sessions;they are full of cheaters and griefers,story mode is also good but not as much as online"
user_76561198984973760,"somehow the anti-cheat has made the public lobbies worse, how is that even possible"
user_76561198234824252,"The recent BattlEye update was very poorly implemented, GTA online is effectively unplayable for me now. 

Also, it broke Steam Deck support and Rockstar have expressed no interest in rectifying this, even though it is essentially a checkbox on their end."
user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.
user_76561199470949442,"story mode, cool. dont let the youtubers fool you gta online is ass. it says 165 hours played a good half of that is loading screens"
user_76561199059925301,"This game is very good, although the machine configuration is slightly low FPS, but when setting is very smooth. In the end, this game is great, top -notch graphics, true character, 100 points."
user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"
user_76561199446581039,I have played this game for over 1000 hours and just got banned from online for NO REASON!!! I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?
user_76561198139132610,"After ten years they finally decided to add an anti cheat.
Yet they chose one of the most limp dick ones possible, fucking battle eye.
That piece of dogshit can barely detect fucking cheat engine.
They also knowingly chose to not enable steam deck/Linux support too.

Great job, amazing.
Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay. I turned to both supportdesks of Valve and Rockstar and am still not one step further. Blocking Linux for GTA ONline is not nice... Storymode is long finished. Please allow Linux support in Battleye.
user_76561198101338167,"Years of progress lost in one email…Played on invite only and stayed away from modding and glitches.... and still got character reset and 30 day suspension. 
 I may be just a drop in the bucket for rockstar massive revenue but I’ll take my drop somewhere else. 
Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."
user_76561198179528533,"I've been a GTA Online user since 2013. They will drain every little penny out of your pockets for in game currency that isn't worth much.

Played this game on PS3, PS4, PC, and Steam Deck.

Tell me why Take Two suddenly decides to implement an anti-cheat after a decade and completely lock out Linux users?

Baffling decision by a company that hates it's userbase."

user_76561199430002719,I love the gta online on my steam deck. I can play anywhere but they changed it. It became unverified and I can’t play online anymore. I deserve a refund for this asap
user_76561199350702317,"Things this game offers: Crappy Servers, A Fully Un-Customer-Oriented and an Un-Moddable Experience, Rampant Cheating (even with BattlEye), Frequent Server Disconnection, Very Long Load Times, 90% of Affordable Cars Removed, Every Update Breaks Mods of Developers Who Work Day and Night, Traffic that Purposely Damages Your Vehicle, 12 Story DLCs Scrapped to Make Way for MoneyPit Online, A Corporate Greed Company, an Amazingly Dedicated Community Who Constantly Get Attacked, and the Most Grind-to-Win Game in Existence. 

Things This Game Doesn't Offer: Stress-Relief, Quality Content Updates, Affordable Cars, and a lot more.

In the current state of GTA V I can truly say it is not worth it. With every update, it somehow gets worse and worse. I don't expect them to fix this, and you shouldn't either...

ROCKSTAR HAS LOST THEIR WAY!"
user_76561198201904638,"Good job rockstar! After all those years decide to implement an anti-cheat, that just jakes away the ability for a substantial amount of your userbase to even play the game. This has nothing to do with making the game more fair, it's just for YOUR monetary GREED!
And then you say that it's VALVE's fault that it's not supported on SteamDeck you clowns! 🤡
What are they supposed to do? Install windows on them?

This is not how you treat your community. And I wont install Windows just to play your stale game whenever I have the need to just cruise around."
user_76561198363435506,Removal of Linux support due to changes to an anti cheat system that supports Linux is unacceptable. This was a great game but the developers still managed to ruin it.
user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."
user_76561198252209124,"This game was great on Steam Deck before last update. Now after update, I can only play Story mode and receive a BattlEye error when trying to load Online mode. Rockstar now says this game isn’t supported on Steam Deck even though it worked before and was a top played Steam Deck game. Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues. I feel scammed since I bought a game & they took away my access to online mode even though it worked before."
user_76561198025005776,"Whoa! This game went from one of my favorites to one that I cannot play anymore! It’s pretty poor taste for Rockstar to update a game that runs great on my Steam Deck then puts out an update that breaks it.

I expected more from you, Rockstar. Shame on you."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198201904638,"Good job rockstar! After all those years decide to implement an anti-cheat, that just jakes away the ability for a substantial amount of your userbase to even play the game. This has nothing to do with making the game more fair, it's just for YOUR monetary GREED!
And then you say that it's VALVE's fault that it's not supported on SteamDeck you clowns! 🤡
What are they supposed to do? Install windows on them?

This is not how you treat your community. And I wont install Windows just to play your stale game whenever I have the need to just cruise around."
user_76561198363435506,Removal of Linux support due to changes to an anti cheat system that supports Linux is unacceptable. This was a great game but the developers still managed to ruin it.
user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."
user_76561198252209124,"This game was great on Steam Deck before last update. Now after update, I can only play Story mode and receive a BattlEye error when trying to load Online mode. Rockstar now says this game isn’t supported on Steam Deck even though it worked before and was a top played Steam Deck game. Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues. I feel scammed since I bought a game & they took away my access to online mode even though it worked before."
user_76561198025005776,"Whoa! This game went from one of my favorites to one that I cannot play anymore! It’s pretty poor taste for Rockstar to update a game that runs great on my Steam Deck then puts out an update that breaks it.

I expected more from you, Rockstar. Shame on you."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

user_76561198039765694,"Good game, but they broke online support on Linux/Steam deck for no reason. all they have to do is check a single box to make it work and they refuse to. Greedy and shortsighted. It literally worked a month ago just fine and now they took the game away."
user_76561198188869502,I played the Game on Steam Deck. Sadly the Anti-Cheat implementation makes GTA Online unplayable on Linux (and doesnt even fix the cheating).... Please add Steam Deck Support again Rockstar!!!!

user_76561198234824252,"The recent BattlEye update was very poorly implemented, GTA online is effectively unplayable for me now. 

Also, it broke Steam Deck support and Rockstar have expressed no interest in rectifying this, even though it is essentially a checkbox on their end."
user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.
user_76561199470949442,"story mode, cool. dont let the youtubers fool you gta online is ass. it says 165 hours played a good half of that is loading screens"

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198022696711,No longer supports Linux/Steam Deck because they refuse to click a checkbox to enable the support for their new maleware anticheat.
user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."
user_76561198252209124,"This game was great on Steam Deck before last update. Now after update, I can only play Story mode and receive a BattlEye error when trying to load Online mode. Rockstar now says this game isn’t supported on Steam Deck even though it worked before and was a top played Steam Deck game. Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues. I feel scammed since I bought a game & they took away my access to online mode even though it worked before."
user_76561198025005776,"Whoa! This game went from one of my favorites to one that I cannot play anymore! It’s pretty poor taste for Rockstar to update a game that runs great on my Steam Deck then puts out an update that breaks it.

I expected more from you, Rockstar. Shame on you."
user_76561198056741646,"I spent over a thousand hours in the game and was suddenly banned and my GTA online character wiped. No reason given. No appeal process. Los Santos was my escape from covid and I am honestly kinda devastated.
Update: Appeal denied. Goodbye Los Santos, you will be missed. Rockstar will not be."

They picked on that is not compatible with linux, unless they literally check a box, which they did not do and said they will not do. So all linux users, including all steam decks, now cant play the game. just straight up locked out. I will be trying to get my money back, and you'll never catch me giving Rockstar money ever again. This is the last straw for me. I do not reccoment this game, or red dead, or gta 6. This company will cheat you out of every cent they can."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out."
user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."
user_76561198106848097,"Shafted Linux Support and blamed the Steam Deck for not supporting the Anti-Cheat when Proton supports it, they blamed Steam Deck because they could not be asked to request to BattlEye to enable Linux Support, it's not that difficult, Rockstar!

user_76561198080889048,"The devs are willing to put in the work to implement BattlEye but not the work to ensure it works with Linux.

user_76561199095755744,"Broskis really added an anti-cheat to a 9 years old game, and even though the anti-cheat has full support for Linux, and requires NO effort on the developers to add it, they refuse to support Linux. I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.

Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

They picked on that is not compatible with linux, unless they literally check a box, which they did not do and said they will not do. So all linux users, including all steam decks, now cant play the game. just straight up locked out. I will be trying to get my money back, and you'll never catch me giving Rockstar money ever again. This is the last straw for me. I do not reccoment this game, or red dead, or gta 6. This company will cheat you out of every cent they can."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out."
user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.

user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.

user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

With the new Anti-cheat system

they lost a part of their users (linux/steam deck)

they made another part of them unhappy (invasive anticheat)

their target (hackers) was unaffected (avoided 23 hours later)

Rockstar is an absolutely pathetic scam of a company and frankly, this type of behavior should result in games being removed from Steam.

Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."

In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out."
user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

Shame on you, Rockstar!"

I don’t, however, love Rockstar games. My only gaming device is a Steam Deck, and they decided to rip this game away from the Steam Deck community rather than spend a little extra time confirming the compatibility with Proton.

Honestly really disappointed in Rockstar, but not surprised."

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.
user_76561198203790740,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.

Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

I bought this game without the extra malware and to have it added after the fact is ridiculous at all, but especially so when it actively results in the removal of peoples ability to play."
user_76561198056165488,"I mainly play on the Steam Deck with my wife on the computer, so thank you for introducing this absolutely useless update that will solve nothing whatsoever at the expense of locking a number of players out of the game. Modders have already figured out how to bypass the anti-cheat, so give yourselves a pat on the back for creating more problems instead of just having proper dedicated servers.

May I also add that Battleye is actually supported on Linux, and Rockstar just simply chooses not to enable it."

user_76561197979843175,"Recently, and without warning, Rock* decided to drop support for Linux players by updating their anti-cheat software. Valve says it is incredibly easy for the developer to fix, but as usual, this has fallen on deaf ears. Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."
user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198060191168,"Rockstar does it again. Understand that the people that work there are a bunch of azzgoblins hellbent on making you have the worst experience possible until you eventually hate GTAO and quit playing it, or at least quit playing it. 
In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I am so glad I never bought Red Dead Redemtion2 and I will never get GTA6. You probably shouldn't either."
user_76561199083523510,"What the actual f..... My account earned a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe and for what?... Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people."

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Can't wait for new players, old players, MTX whales, and the onslaught of dickheads to migrate to GTA 6.
Eventually GTA6 Online will be the game I pick up once a year for a week or month to have some fun with mates and remember why we left.
Here's to another financially lucrative/creatively bankrupt decade for Take-Two/Rockstar."
user_76561198069493994,"For years GTA V (and by extension its built-in online play) under Linux has worked more or less perfectly with Take2 and R* having to do nothing except provide the Windows binaries of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

Hope the lost sales of GTA VI etc make it worth it since from now on I'm certainly ignoring the existence of anything published by Rockstar Games or Take2 (:"

I still wonder why a game should have kernel level access to the OS, but that is beside the point since the game worked for years, and apparently the anti cheat used by Rockstar works with the Steam Deck if they want it to."

I just did waste several hours downloading GTA V just to not be able to play online.
Good thing i'm drunk."
user_76561198257080570,"Added BattleEye without Linux support, so it's no longer playable on the Steam Deck"
user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?

Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay. I turned to both supportdesks of Valve and Rockstar and am still not one step further. Blocking Linux for GTA ONline is not nice... Storymode is long finished. Please allow Linux support in Battleye.

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.
user_76561198203790740,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I am so glad I never bought Red Dead Redemtion2 and I will never get GTA6. You probably shouldn't either."
user_76561199083523510,"What the actual f..... My account earned a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe and for what?... Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people."
user_76561198096706151,"Game is fun, but can't be played by linux or steam deck users now. Modders will be back in a week but linux players won't. Refund the game under Steam Play Issues if you are a linux user."

I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198257080570,"Added BattleEye without Linux support, so it's no longer playable on the Steam Deck"
user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

On top of that, it was bypassed shortly after it's inclusion making it utterly worthless. Now it effectively serves only to bar innocent users from playing what they paid for."
user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game. I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

Shame on you, Rockstar!"

Honestly really disappointed in Rockstar, but not surprised."

user_76561198069493994,"For years GTA V (and by extension its built-in online play) under Linux has worked more or less perfectly with Take2 and R* having to do nothing except provide the Windows binaries of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?
user_76561198139132610,"After ten years they finally decided to add an anti cheat.
Yet they chose one of the most limp dick ones possible, fucking battle eye.

They also knowingly chose to not enable steam deck/Linux support too.

Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay.

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198025484300,"Imagine killing a popular 10 year old game for Linux/Steamdeck users entirely just because you are mad that PC players arent getting extorted into buying shark cards to be able to actually play the game at the same rate as console players. 
Not to mention adding kernel level anticheat not months after the largest computer outage in history was caused by a buggy patch to kernel level software."
user_76561198039765694,"Good game, but they broke online support on Linux/Steam deck for no reason. all they have to do is check a single box to make it work and they refuse to. Greedy and shortsighted. It literally worked a month ago just fine and now they took the game away."
user_76561198188869502,I played the Game on Steam Deck. Sadly the Anti-Cheat implementation makes GTA Online unplayable on Linux (and doesnt even fix the cheating).... Please add Steam Deck Support again Rockstar!!!!
user_76561198002450035,"Added a third-party anti-cheat 9 years after release which disables online play for all Linux and subsequently Steam Deck users, wonder if I can get a refund."
user_76561199765579053,"Game is immmersive and fun but only if you play in private invite only session with friends,avoid public sessions;they are full of cheaters and griefers,story mode is also good but not as much as online"
user_76561198984973760,"somehow the anti-cheat has made the public lobbies worse, how is that even possible"
user_76561198234824252,"The recent BattlEye update was very poorly implemented, GTA online is effectively unplayable for me now. 

Also, it broke Steam Deck support and Rockstar have expressed no interest in rectifying this, even though it is essentially a checkbox on their end."
user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.
user_76561199470949442,"story mode, cool. dont let the youtubers fool you gta online is ass. it says 165 hours played a good half of that is loading screens"
user_76561199059925301,"This game is very good, although the machine configuration is slightly low FPS, but when setting is very smooth. In the end, this game is great, top -notch graphics, true character, 100 points."
user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"
user_76561199446581039,I have played this game for over 1000 hours and just got banned from online for NO REASON!!! I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?
user_76561198139132610,"After ten years they finally decided to add an anti cheat.
Yet they chose one of the most limp dick ones possible, fucking battle eye.
That piece of dogshit can barely detect fucking cheat engine.
They also knowingly chose to not enable steam deck/Linux support too.

Great job, amazing.
Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay. I turned to both supportdesks of Valve and Rockstar and am still not one step further. Blocking Linux for GTA ONline is not nice... Storymode is long finished. Please allow Linux support in Battleye.
user_76561198101338167,"Years of progress lost in one email…Played on invite only and stayed away from modding and glitches.... and still got character reset and 30 day suspension. 
 I may be just a drop in the bucket for rockstar massive revenue but I’ll take my drop somewhere else. 
Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."
user_76561198179528533,"I've been a GTA Online user since 2013. They will drain every little penny out of your pockets for in game currency that isn't worth much.

Played this game on PS3, PS4, PC, and Steam Deck.

Tell me why Take Two suddenly decides to implement an anti-cheat after a decade and completely lock out Linux users?

Baffling decision by a company that hates it's userbase."

user_76561199430002719,I love the gta online on my steam deck. I can play anywhere but they changed it. It became unverified and I can’t play online anymore. I deserve a refund for this asap
user_76561199350702317,"Things this game offers: Crappy Servers, A Fully Un-Customer-Oriented and an Un-Moddable Experience, Rampant Cheating (even with BattlEye), Frequent Server Disconnection, Very Long Load Times, 90% of Affordable Cars Removed, Every Update Breaks Mods of Developers Who Work Day and Night, Traffic that Purposely Damages Your Vehicle, 12 Story DLCs Scrapped to Make Way for MoneyPit Online, A Corporate Greed Company, an Amazingly Dedicated Community Who Constantly Get Attacked, and the Most Grind-to-Win Game in Existence. 

Things This Game Doesn't Offer: Stress-Relief, Quality Content Updates, Affordable Cars, and a lot more.

In the current state of GTA V I can truly say it is not worth it. With every update, it somehow gets worse and worse. I don't expect them to fix this, and you shouldn't either...

ROCKSTAR HAS LOST THEIR WAY!"
user_76561198201904638,"Good job rockstar! After all those years decide to implement an anti-cheat, that just jakes away the ability for a substantial amount of your userbase to even play the game. This has nothing to do with making the game more fair, it's just for YOUR monetary GREED!
And then you say that it's VALVE's fault that it's not supported on SteamDeck you clowns! 🤡
What are they supposed to do? Install windows on them?

This is not how you treat your community. And I wont install Windows just to play your stale game whenever I have the need to just cruise around."
user_76561198363435506,Removal of Linux support due to changes to an anti cheat system that supports Linux is unacceptable. This was a great game but the developers still managed to ruin it.
user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."
user_76561198252209124,"This game was great on Steam Deck before last update. Now after update, I can only play Story mode and receive a BattlEye error when trying to load Online mode. Rockstar now says this game isn’t supported on Steam Deck even though it worked before and was a top played Steam Deck game. Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues. I feel scammed since I bought a game & they took away my access to online mode even though it worked before."
user_76561198025005776,"Whoa! This game went from one of my favorites to one that I cannot play anymore! It’s pretty poor taste for Rockstar to update a game that runs great on my Steam Deck then puts out an update that breaks it.

I expected more from you, Rockstar. Shame on you."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198201904638,"Good job rockstar! After all those years decide to implement an anti-cheat, that just jakes away the ability for a substantial amount of your userbase to even play the game. This has nothing to do with making the game more fair, it's just for YOUR monetary GREED!
And then you say that it's VALVE's fault that it's not supported on SteamDeck you clowns! 🤡
What are they supposed to do? Install windows on them?

This is not how you treat your community. And I wont install Windows just to play your stale game whenever I have the need to just cruise around."
user_76561198363435506,Removal of Linux support due to changes to an anti cheat system that supports Linux is unacceptable. This was a great game but the developers still managed to ruin it.
user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."
user_76561198252209124,"This game was great on Steam Deck before last update. Now after update, I can only play Story mode and receive a BattlEye error when trying to load Online mode. Rockstar now says this game isn’t supported on Steam Deck even though it worked before and was a top played Steam Deck game. Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues. I feel scammed since I bought a game & they took away my access to online mode even though it worked before."
user_76561198025005776,"Whoa! This game went from one of my favorites to one that I cannot play anymore! It’s pretty poor taste for Rockstar to update a game that runs great on my Steam Deck then puts out an update that breaks it.

I expected more from you, Rockstar. Shame on you."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

user_76561198039765694,"Good game, but they broke online support on Linux/Steam deck for no reason. all they have to do is check a single box to make it work and they refuse to. Greedy and shortsighted. It literally worked a month ago just fine and now they took the game away."
user_76561198188869502,I played the Game on Steam Deck. Sadly the Anti-Cheat implementation makes GTA Online unplayable on Linux (and doesnt even fix the cheating).... Please add Steam Deck Support again Rockstar!!!!

user_76561198234824252,"The recent BattlEye update was very poorly implemented, GTA online is effectively unplayable for me now. 

Also, it broke Steam Deck support and Rockstar have expressed no interest in rectifying this, even though it is essentially a checkbox on their end."
user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.
user_76561199470949442,"story mode, cool. dont let the youtubers fool you gta online is ass. it says 165 hours played a good half of that is loading screens"

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198022696711,No longer supports Linux/Steam Deck because they refuse to click a checkbox to enable the support for their new maleware anticheat.
user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."
user_76561198252209124,"This game was great on Steam Deck before last update. Now after update, I can only play Story mode and receive a BattlEye error when trying to load Online mode. Rockstar now says this game isn’t supported on Steam Deck even though it worked before and was a top played Steam Deck game. Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues. I feel scammed since I bought a game & they took away my access to online mode even though it worked before."
user_76561198025005776,"Whoa! This game went from one of my favorites to one that I cannot play anymore! It’s pretty poor taste for Rockstar to update a game that runs great on my Steam Deck then puts out an update that breaks it.

I expected more from you, Rockstar. Shame on you."
user_76561198056741646,"I spent over a thousand hours in the game and was suddenly banned and my GTA online character wiped. No reason given. No appeal process. Los Santos was my escape from covid and I am honestly kinda devastated.
Update: Appeal denied. Goodbye Los Santos, you will be missed. Rockstar will not be."

They picked on that is not compatible with linux, unless they literally check a box, which they did not do and said they will not do. So all linux users, including all steam decks, now cant play the game. just straight up locked out. I will be trying to get my money back, and you'll never catch me giving Rockstar money ever again. This is the last straw for me. I do not reccoment this game, or red dead, or gta 6. This company will cheat you out of every cent they can."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out."
user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."
user_76561198106848097,"Shafted Linux Support and blamed the Steam Deck for not supporting the Anti-Cheat when Proton supports it, they blamed Steam Deck because they could not be asked to request to BattlEye to enable Linux Support, it's not that difficult, Rockstar!

user_76561198080889048,"The devs are willing to put in the work to implement BattlEye but not the work to ensure it works with Linux.

user_76561199095755744,"Broskis really added an anti-cheat to a 9 years old game, and even though the anti-cheat has full support for Linux, and requires NO effort on the developers to add it, they refuse to support Linux. I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.

Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

They picked on that is not compatible with linux, unless they literally check a box, which they did not do and said they will not do. So all linux users, including all steam decks, now cant play the game. just straight up locked out. I will be trying to get my money back, and you'll never catch me giving Rockstar money ever again. This is the last straw for me. I do not reccoment this game, or red dead, or gta 6. This company will cheat you out of every cent they can."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out."
user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.

user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.

user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

With the new Anti-cheat system

they lost a part of their users (linux/steam deck)

they made another part of them unhappy (invasive anticheat)

their target (hackers) was unaffected (avoided 23 hours later)

Rockstar is an absolutely pathetic scam of a company and frankly, this type of behavior should result in games being removed from Steam.

Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."

In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play. GTA5, it was good to know you, but then you got weird. i'm out."
user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

Shame on you, Rockstar!"

I don’t, however, love Rockstar games. My only gaming device is a Steam Deck, and they decided to rip this game away from the Steam Deck community rather than spend a little extra time confirming the compatibility with Proton.

Honestly really disappointed in Rockstar, but not surprised."

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.
user_76561198203790740,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.

Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

I bought this game without the extra malware and to have it added after the fact is ridiculous at all, but especially so when it actively results in the removal of peoples ability to play."
user_76561198056165488,"I mainly play on the Steam Deck with my wife on the computer, so thank you for introducing this absolutely useless update that will solve nothing whatsoever at the expense of locking a number of players out of the game. Modders have already figured out how to bypass the anti-cheat, so give yourselves a pat on the back for creating more problems instead of just having proper dedicated servers.

May I also add that Battleye is actually supported on Linux, and Rockstar just simply chooses not to enable it."

user_76561197979843175,"Recently, and without warning, Rock* decided to drop support for Linux players by updating their anti-cheat software. Valve says it is incredibly easy for the developer to fix, but as usual, this has fallen on deaf ears. Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."
user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198060191168,"Rockstar does it again. Understand that the people that work there are a bunch of azzgoblins hellbent on making you have the worst experience possible until you eventually hate GTAO and quit playing it, or at least quit playing it. 
In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I am so glad I never bought Red Dead Redemtion2 and I will never get GTA6. You probably shouldn't either."
user_76561199083523510,"What the actual f..... My account earned a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe and for what?... Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people."

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Can't wait for new players, old players, MTX whales, and the onslaught of dickheads to migrate to GTA 6.
Eventually GTA6 Online will be the game I pick up once a year for a week or month to have some fun with mates and remember why we left.
Here's to another financially lucrative/creatively bankrupt decade for Take-Two/Rockstar."
user_76561198069493994,"For years GTA V (and by extension its built-in online play) under Linux has worked more or less perfectly with Take2 and R* having to do nothing except provide the Windows binaries of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

Hope the lost sales of GTA VI etc make it worth it since from now on I'm certainly ignoring the existence of anything published by Rockstar Games or Take2 (:"

I still wonder why a game should have kernel level access to the OS, but that is beside the point since the game worked for years, and apparently the anti cheat used by Rockstar works with the Steam Deck if they want it to."

I just did waste several hours downloading GTA V just to not be able to play online.
Good thing i'm drunk."
user_76561198257080570,"Added BattleEye without Linux support, so it's no longer playable on the Steam Deck"
user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?

Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay. I turned to both supportdesks of Valve and Rockstar and am still not one step further. Blocking Linux for GTA ONline is not nice... Storymode is long finished. Please allow Linux support in Battleye.

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."
user_76561198058791979,Apparently it's okay to retroactively break Steam Deck support for anti-cheat after being perfectly playable on it for multiple years.
user_76561198203790740,"Battleye ruined the game. makes online unplayable because it makes you restart for an ""update"" that doesnt exist. it also makes it so that all linux users that have been playing the game for ten years with no issue suddenly cant. garbage"
user_76561198074511976,"As a Linux player I feel like I speak for most. The new anti cheat makes the game impossible to play for Linux players. Played this game sense i was little and it's all gone, do better."
user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play.

user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I am so glad I never bought Red Dead Redemtion2 and I will never get GTA6. You probably shouldn't either."
user_76561199083523510,"What the actual f..... My account earned a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe and for what?... Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason. Cheating has always been a issue on GTA but this... this aint it. R* is punishing the wrong people."
user_76561198096706151,"Game is fun, but can't be played by linux or steam deck users now. Modders will be back in a week but linux players won't. Refund the game under Steam Play Issues if you are a linux user."

I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

That's all there is to know about Rockstar these days.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198257080570,"Added BattleEye without Linux support, so it's no longer playable on the Steam Deck"
user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.

user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

user_76561198198678922,"Steam Deck and Linux users are now unable to play online mode after BattlEye anticheat was added to the game.

On top of that, it was bypassed shortly after it's inclusion making it utterly worthless. Now it effectively serves only to bar innocent users from playing what they paid for."
user_76561198102284690,Battleye being added to stop cheaters only for cheaters to come back 24 hours later and have linux players locked out of GTA online. what a scummy move by Rockstar.
user_76561198076412753,Rockstar banned me when I was out of town. I have never cheated in any way and spent most of my time online in Invite only lobbies. There is no ban appeal and 5+ years of grinding have been reset. I'm never touching GTA again. This is completely ridiculous. Actual cheaters are free to do whatever while us who follow the rules get fucked. Don't waste your time or money on GTA Online.
user_76561198824919692,"I have never written a review for a game in my life, but this is absolutely absurd. I have over 1000 hours in GTA:Online, all on linux, but not shown on my steam profile since I just recently bought it on my steam deck for better compatibility. The fact Rockstar has decided to compltelty remove all linux support for GTA:Online by refusing to check a box is pure laziness and stupidity from Rockstar's team. It used to be my favourite game until this BS happened. Don't buy this scam."
user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"

The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."
user_76561199675292703,"Rating: 3/10
For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

user_76561198085080911,"Got banned for no explanation on why have only been playing on invite only sessions and doing the spinning of the wheel and doing some Hangar missions, No idea if someone hacked my account and got me banned,  on the day I did get banned, I wasn't even playing so I have no idea what happened. Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

Which sucks because I first started playing this game on the PlayStation 3 & 4 And I've been playing it since the online service has come out.

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues.

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support.

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Open two tickets both times no explanation, no help, probably not going to play this game ever again or Grand Theft Auto VI this is ruined my experience of the Grand Theft Auto games.

user_76561198214625400,"On the 17th of September, 2024, 11 years AFTER it released, Rockstar, in their INFINITE wisdom, probably bowing to investor and shareholder pressure, implemented a KERNEL-LEVEL Anti-Cheat to their Online portion of the game. I will never, nor was I ever planning on, playing GTA Online, but if I ever did, I would NEVER be able to play it on Steam Deck, Linux, and/or with Mods, all of which you COULD DO before this stupid update.

Shame on you, Rockstar!"

Honestly really disappointed in Rockstar, but not surprised."

user_76561198069493994,"For years GTA V (and by extension its built-in online play) under Linux has worked more or less perfectly with Take2 and R* having to do nothing except provide the Windows binaries of the game.

With the latest update (September 2024) they've chosen to not Linux support for GTA online despite BattlEye working on Linux; they refused to enable a simple toggle in the anti-cheat configuration and then tried to flip the script with their PR-bullcrap narrative that it's a problem caused by Linux/SteamDeck instead of them choosing to not support the platform.

user_76561198023079465,"UPDATED 10/7/2024

I have been unbanned and compensated with ingame money, but I'm still weary to trust them and I'm still annoyed about them nuking deck support.

So here's the thing, this game's online has had an egregiously bad cheater issue for years.
This ranged anywhere from the standard aimbotting, to people forcing money into your account. In some really fun cases, people would teleport you and everyone in the lobby to one location, kill you repeatedly and then when you're finally free of it you realize they found a way to permanently delete all of the cars you spent hours of time (or your hard earned money) to unlock.

Oh, did I mention the game worked (very VERY important key word being WORKED, past tense) really well on the steam deck?

Enter the Battleye update, September 16th(17th?) 2024;

Hooray they finally gave us some form of Anticheat to make the game even remotely bearable in public lobbies!
Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online.

user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played.

user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"

I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?
user_76561198139132610,"After ten years they finally decided to add an anti cheat.
Yet they chose one of the most limp dick ones possible, fucking battle eye.

They also knowingly chose to not enable steam deck/Linux support too.

Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay.

Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."

user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."

But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

I uninstalled the rockstar launcher and reinstalled. Everything seemed fine, helped someone with their setup and when it was done I got an error and was then told battle eye needed an update...

BULL.......S...........H..........1........T! No reason for battle eye to need an update when it would have been the most previous update after installing. Seems like every time I have momentum in this game it crashes for some unknown reason..... I have a great computer with a fresh install of windows on a brand new SSD.

- Online doesn't work on steam deck anymore because of it
- Rockstar doesn't bother to change anything
- Cheating is still happening but regular players can't play anymore

Thank you for ruining the experience."
user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."
user_76561199584271139,"I was enjoying the game, until they decided to implement an anti-cheat that completely breaks online functionality in Linux.  BattlEye has Linux support, so they basically only have to click a checkbox to enable it.  
This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

I can't tell if this is peak ignorance or peak greediness. But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"
user_76561197994371575,"Contrary to what Rockstar says, they could have made a build using BattlEye anticheat compatible with Linux and Proton. Not only they did not, and therefore, made GTA5 multiplayer unusable for Linux players and Steam Deck users, but they also lied about it.

Also, client-side anticheats are still a terrible solution to cheating in-game, technically and pragmatically, as well as privacy-wise."

user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
user_76561198050405582,"I can no longer recommend this game after their intentional killing of Linux support.

Oh wait, the game no longer works on Steam Deck, at least for the Online mode, oh and all of the people who cheated? Yeah they almost immediately circumvented the ""Anti""cheat within 9ish hours of the update dropping, great job.

The best part? Myself and plenty of other people who haven't once even CONSIDERED cheating have been falsely banned with the added punishment of our characters of however long we had them (in my case 10 years across 3 platforms) were getting WIPED, completely RESET as if I have never even played the game before.

""Just appeal the ban if you're innocent"" Sure ok let's do tha- Oh I see, they won't tell me why I was banned and keep automatically closing my support ticket & setting it to resolved with the EXACT same corporate slop response.

As of writing this review I'm on my 3rd attempt to get a real person to at least talk to me about could have caused my ban.(likely being unlucky and getting dropped into a public lobby with a cheater as I exited mission, something I have no control of)

Regardless of if I even get my character back (I don't expect to if I'm being honest, this is Rockstar after all) the review will stay negative, what a joke.

Save your money and buy literally anything else."
user_76561198041488652,"Rockstar could have easily developed server-side anticheat for the game, which would block the vast majority of the game-breaking cheats people use online. But no, they had to go with BattleEye, and they didn't even bother to enable Linux support. Rockstar is lazy and does not deserve your money."

user_76561198025484300,"Imagine killing a popular 10 year old game for Linux/Steamdeck users entirely just because you are mad that PC players arent getting extorted into buying shark cards to be able to actually play the game at the same rate as console players. 
Not to mention adding kernel level anticheat not months after the largest computer outage in history was caused by a buggy patch to kernel level software."
user_76561198039765694,"Good game, but they broke online support on Linux/Steam deck for no reason. all they have to do is check a single box to make it work and they refuse to. Greedy and shortsighted. It literally worked a month ago just fine and now they took the game away."
user_76561198188869502,I played the Game on Steam Deck. Sadly the Anti-Cheat implementation makes GTA Online unplayable on Linux (and doesnt even fix the cheating).... Please add Steam Deck Support again Rockstar!!!!
user_76561198002450035,"Added a third-party anti-cheat 9 years after release which disables online play for all Linux and subsequently Steam Deck users, wonder if I can get a refund."
user_76561199765579053,"Game is immmersive and fun but only if you play in private invite only session with friends,avoid public sessions;they are full of cheaters and griefers,story mode is also good but not as much as online"
user_76561198984973760,"somehow the anti-cheat has made the public lobbies worse, how is that even possible"
user_76561198234824252,"The recent BattlEye update was very poorly implemented, GTA online is effectively unplayable for me now. 

Also, it broke Steam Deck support and Rockstar have expressed no interest in rectifying this, even though it is essentially a checkbox on their end."
user_76561198022797030,My first and probably only review but it had to be done. I have been playing GTA Online for 1000+ hours but was randomly banned while I was afk. My account was apparently reset so it might as well be 0 hours played. Tried contacting Rockstar Support but they were unable to elaborate on the 30 day ban/account reset or provide any help in restoring the account. I have never modded/cheated/exploited GTA Online since I started playing back in 2013.
user_76561199470949442,"story mode, cool. dont let the youtubers fool you gta online is ass. it says 165 hours played a good half of that is loading screens"
user_76561199059925301,"This game is very good, although the machine configuration is slightly low FPS, but when setting is very smooth. In the end, this game is great, top -notch graphics, true character, 100 points."
user_76561198108200973,"Years too late they want to fix their hacker issue by implementing BattleEye, while also giving a big FU to steamdeck owners or linux users across the world.

They can make it still work on steam os and linux but are choosing not to.

Oh well, its an old ass game, with clunky controls, and long ass load times. You already lost me as a player from the years and years of wild west hackers being obnoxious.

Rockstar has milked this game to its fullest, so it doesnt mind losing its steam/linux base. Broke kids will still load up their rusty ass GTA V on their windows machines (make sure to clean out those dusty ass towers boys).

Rockstar, I'm done with your clunky games, they're not even that good, and you're anti consumer.

I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THEIR STEAMDECK REQUEST A REFUND."
user_76561197985934025,"Unfortunately GTAO is not safe to play on PC, since Rockstar will arbitrarily ban you with no recourse. Their anticheat software is sloppy and flags innocent people, but they refuse to allow their support to acknowledge this fact (despite the many known bugs in their games over the years). I would recommend only playing it on console.  Personally I will not be buying GTA6 or any other Rockstar products in future. You might not believe it, until it happens to you too."
user_76561198069528606,"Rockstar has suddenly decided to add a kernel level rootkit; BattlEye, to a game that is a decade old. As such I immediately had to restore my PC to an old backup and uninstall GTA before it could install the rootkit. Kernel-level software, like this, has deep access to your system, which raises serious privacy and security concerns. There's no way to ensure it's not being used maliciously. 

The fact that it's being implemented retroactively, so long after the game's release, makes it feel like false advertising. Many of us bought and played this game under the assumption that no such intrusive software was involved, and this change comes long after the purchase. There was no indication this would be the case until today, 9/17/24.

Unless Rockstar reverses this decision my review will remain negative."
user_76561197986573121,"Block the access to linux players even when the forced installation of stupid battleeye is actually supported on linux, and maybe the more important question is why does every idiot game need rootkit or kernel level of access of anticheat pos software?"
user_76561199446581039,I have played this game for over 1000 hours and just got banned from online for NO REASON!!! I was playing story mode and all of a sudden got a notice my account has been banned! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Rockstar email says there is no appeals to bans and that all ban decisions are final. So I get screwed for playing your game in story mode and now I dont even have the opportunity go into online. WTF?
user_76561198139132610,"After ten years they finally decided to add an anti cheat.
Yet they chose one of the most limp dick ones possible, fucking battle eye.
That piece of dogshit can barely detect fucking cheat engine.
They also knowingly chose to not enable steam deck/Linux support too.

Great job, amazing.
Rockstar continues to innovate in making their great games worse."
user_76561198059721326,Since the Battleye integration GTA online is not playable anymore on the Steam Deck. Simply blocked out after hundreds of hours honest gameplay. I turned to both supportdesks of Valve and Rockstar and am still not one step further. Blocking Linux for GTA ONline is not nice... Storymode is long finished. Please allow Linux support in Battleye.
user_76561198101338167,"Years of progress lost in one email…Played on invite only and stayed away from modding and glitches.... and still got character reset and 30 day suspension. 
 I may be just a drop in the bucket for rockstar massive revenue but I’ll take my drop somewhere else. 
Thanks for the memories."
user_76561198244775674,"The game has just been updated to add an anti cheat called BattleEye. 

Cool right? No. Its not cool because Rockstar just INTENTIONALLY blocked  the Steam Deck and all other Linux users from GTA Online because they refuse to tick the box that enables Linux support in BattleEye. BattleEye does indeed support Linux, its just an option that developers have to enable.

I understand that GTA V has never actually supported the Deck or Linux. However, it has worked flawlessly for years and the fact that they made the conscious decision to not only avoid, but REFUSE to enable the the Linux support that is, from my understanding, as simple as ticking a box that is BUILT INTO the anti cheat they chose is just unacceptable.

My assumption is that this will be implemented into GTA VI the exact same way but day 1, rather than  a decade later. Even if it dosen't, i will not be spending my money on it because i will never put my trust in Rockstar again."
user_76561198179528533,"I've been a GTA Online user since 2013. They will drain every little penny out of your pockets for in game currency that isn't worth much.

Played this game on PS3, PS4, PC, and Steam Deck.

Tell me why Take Two suddenly decides to implement an anti-cheat after a decade and completely lock out Linux users?

Baffling decision by a company that hates it's userbase."

user_76561199430002719,I love the gta online on my steam deck. I can play anywhere but they changed it. It became unverified and I can’t play online anymore. I deserve a refund for this asap
user_76561199350702317,"Things this game offers: Crappy Servers, A Fully Un-Customer-Oriented and an Un-Moddable Experience, Rampant Cheating (even with BattlEye), Frequent Server Disconnection, Very Long Load Times, 90% of Affordable Cars Removed, Every Update Breaks Mods of Developers Who Work Day and Night, Traffic that Purposely Damages Your Vehicle, 12 Story DLCs Scrapped to Make Way for MoneyPit Online, A Corporate Greed Company, an Amazingly Dedicated Community Who Constantly Get Attacked, and the Most Grind-to-Win Game in Existence. 

Things This Game Doesn't Offer: Stress-Relief, Quality Content Updates, Affordable Cars, and a lot more.

In the current state of GTA V I can truly say it is not worth it. With every update, it somehow gets worse and worse. I don't expect them to fix this, and you shouldn't either...

ROCKSTAR HAS LOST THEIR WAY!"
user_76561198201904638,"Good job rockstar! After all those years decide to implement an anti-cheat, that just jakes away the ability for a substantial amount of your userbase to even play the game. This has nothing to do with making the game more fair, it's just for YOUR monetary GREED!
And then you say that it's VALVE's fault that it's not supported on SteamDeck you clowns! 🤡
What are they supposed to do? Install windows on them?

This is not how you treat your community. And I wont install Windows just to play your stale game whenever I have the need to just cruise around."
user_76561198363435506,Removal of Linux support due to changes to an anti cheat system that supports Linux is unacceptable. This was a great game but the developers still managed to ruin it.
user_76561198015324861,"Singleplayer: 9/10

The singleplayer story is great, the use of 3 main characters you switch between offers some nice twist in storytelling, and the fact you are not focused on one player character helps with forming the individual characters of these three, they can get away with stuff you would bother with if it was only a single character you play and have to get immersed with. I mean, the parts where you play Trevor being a psychopath are fun, but a whole game just Trevor would be too much imho.


Online with friends: 8/10
Online with randos: 6/10
Online with cheaters/griefers: 1/10

Since they changed it so you can do most stuff in single/closed friend sessions, you can avoid all the griefers and cheaters out there, but if you want some chaotic fun, finding a lobby with other legit players can be a pleasent surprise and perhaps worth looking for."
user_76561198252209124,"This game was great on Steam Deck before last update. Now after update, I can only play Story mode and receive a BattlEye error when trying to load Online mode. Rockstar now says this game isn’t supported on Steam Deck even though it worked before and was a top played Steam Deck game. Meanwhile, BattlEye is compatible with SD & Linux, Rockstar just didn’t bother to enable it. Instead of Rockstar fixing this they are telling SD users to contact Valve with any issues. I feel scammed since I bought a game & they took away my access to online mode even though it worked before."
user_76561198025005776,"Whoa! This game went from one of my favorites to one that I cannot play anymore! It’s pretty poor taste for Rockstar to update a game that runs great on my Steam Deck then puts out an update that breaks it.

I expected more from you, Rockstar. Shame on you."

user_76561198288086613,"i have played over 1,000 hours of GTA5. gotta say i enjoy the immersion, the various challenges, both in story mode and online, but dislike that the more i do, the greater the odds of my businesses getting raided. i would have expected the raids to be based on me gaining wealth or becoming so successful that enemies noticed me but instead the game hits you with a raid simply based on if you fail to multitask quickly enough. *shrug* it is what it is. until sep 17 2024, i would have said that the worst part was the cheaters, however rockstar surprised me. as of today, they demand that i allow some 3rd-party company to gain intimate access to my computer (kernel-level access) or they won't let me play the game i payed for. no way (in very profane terms) has this been necessary for the past 11 years, it's not necessary now, it adds no value to the game, it simply permits spyware to see everything inside my computer, which includes keylogging, personal files, financial records, legal documents, and browser history. nope. i can't go there. the game has been great, i think it is one of the best i've ever played (see previous transmission re: 1,000 hours of game play), but this sort of blackmail should be illegal. i uninstalled the game, dropped to steam to explain why, and will go find something else to play.

user_76561198095069234,"I like this game. I really do - it's one of the most fun experiences to play with friends hands down.
But I can't let go of what happened recently.

I got my account suspended, and character deleted, for violating their Terms of Service - I never cheated nor empathized with cheaters and I mostly played alone. 
I'm writing this negative review for the negative experience I have been given by support after submitting two support tickets, not only trying to appeal my suspension, but to understand why this had happened. In classic Rockstar fashion, I was not given a direct response. Maybe it's a software I have that conflicted with the new anti-cheat, but I couldn't know for sure. (if they indeed did disclose it I could avoid any future software conflicts, so problem is not solved. Shouldn't take an degree to understand this).

I'm more upset at the time I've spent, while I could've played other games or done other things instead of spending +600 online grinding unhappily on my own. But that's on me.

I feel betrayed and disrespected, this is not how you treat your clients - ""best regards"", they said.

(very dramatic, I know)

EDIT: after around a week of the second ticket, I received an e-mail regarding the status of my account - my suspension was lifted after Rockstar reviewed my account.

I understand bros cheat a lot, hence the ""no ban appeals"" policy. But you simply cannot apply these rules for these specific situations. I appreciate whomever reviewed my account."

In there last kcid move they made GTAO unplayable for Steam Deck users, way to go guys!
If you are on PC you have to install some anti-cheat malware that requires crazy access to your system that modders and cheaters will by-pass at some point anyways and Rockstar will no care when they do.

Seems this new anti cheat thinks 90 hours of full legit game play is unacceptable although real hackers continue to enjoy the game. It feels as though R* wants to rid themselves of all players. Those who played on linux and steam deck can no longer play and now apparently every other player too, I have spoken to and seen countless other players being banned for nothing with over 2000+ hours on the game. There isnt even a point in playing the game again, I will never put in anymore of my time nor will i get GTA6 just for all my progress to be wiped away for ZERO reason.

user_76561198141514164,"One of the best GTA games without a doubt.
I only played the single player part of the game and it's great even though if i was to compare it with the previous one, GTA IV... GTA IV had ""more meat"" on it.

What do i mean with ""more meat""  ...more sidequests, more side activities, a lot of great characters to meet and develop relationships with male and female characters, comedy clubs to visit.
They did a good job with GTA V... okay but in comparison to GTA IV it's lacking.
Part of this reason is cause they never delivered on their promise for more story DLC missions once they got their success with the online part of the game, intatiably greedy (RockStar).
The map feels considerably smaller as well...

So... game's good but it feels lacking in terms of what it's predecessor did (single player), greately.
Sad tbh."

This is disgusting anti-consumer behavior."
user_76561199070440445,"I don't know where to start with GTA V, because there's just so much to praise about it. 

GTA V is not just a game; it’s an experience, a living, breathing world that feels as real and as rich as any city in the real world. Whether you're navigating high-speed chases, planning complex heists, collecting rare vehicles or simply cruising around the sun-drenched coastline, every moment spent in this game is unforgettable especially when playing with friends. 

I honestly don’t know if I can do GTA V justice in just a review, because it’s one of those rare games that seems to have it all. A compelling story, unforgettable characters, a living world that feels alive with possibility, and gameplay that remains fresh and exciting even after years. Whether you’re playing the single-player campaign or diving into GTA Online, you’re guaranteed to be hooked. This is the kind of game that sets the bar for what open-world gaming can and should be.

Final Verdict: 
My love for the game began back in the days of San Andreas on my original Xbox, and it's still going strong to this day. 
I wanna say thank you to Rockstar Games for putting out one of the best games if not thee best game of our generation.  

And to anyone who loves exceptional storytelling, a massive open world, and a gameplay experience that never stops giving, this is the game for you. Rating: 11/10 – A definitive must-play."

But Rockstar has been going down for a while, treating PC players like second class users, releasing updates and even games later to PC, tricking users into buying their same games more than once by re-releasing the same games multiple times, requiring to use some crappy 3rd party launcher over Steam, Rockstar wins the laziest company award."
user_76561198204486627,"DO NOT buy, refund if possible.

Context: I have played GTA V and Online for over 6 years, with almost 1700 hours to date. I know basically all of this game's nooks and crannies, as well as its glaring issues.

The Online experience is still one of the worst in online gaming. It's a broken mess full of cheaters and extremely predatory monetization tactics. Now, Rockstar decided to slap on a rootkit as the cherry on top.

I'm writing this review primarily because of the recent addition of the extremely invasive client-side kernel-level anti-cheat Battleye, which was added as a cheating (or ""modding"", as it's known in GTA) countermeasure. This will not only *not* solve the cheating problems but eliminates the Steam Deck & Linux player base entirely.

This game is probably one of the worst you can play with an active internet connection because, especially in the recent years, hackers have been to:

- Kick you out of your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Crash your game through Rockstar Social Club, even in Story Mode
- Corrupt your account data using your Social Club ID and prevent you from logging back in and playing
- DDoS you and everybody in your session
- Gain remote code execution capability via security vulnerabilities (fixed a while ago AFAIK, but I still wouldn't trust Rockstar)
- Destroy all of your hard-earned work from your businesses in Online Mode
- Screw you over when playing private races or missions in solo sessions with friends

...and much, much more.

The game uses peer-to-peer networking architecture as its primary way of connecting players in sessions. It doesn't sanitize and validate data coming from other players that is received by your client. The game doesn't even have basic server-side ""cheating"" validation of anything in the current session (player cash, movement, physics) and allows anybody to mess with it using mod menus.

Now, the client-side anti-cheat, which is essentially a rootkit that can cause immense damage to your system if abused (see the CrowdStrike outage impact), adds another point of failure, another background processes lowering your performance, and kills the Linux and Steam Deck player base, all while not solving the issues with the game's ancient netcode and lack of data validation, while *still* being bypassable (see client-side AC bypassing and hardware DMA cheating methods online if you're interested).

Not to mention that Rockstar has been milking the last drops from GTA Online since the last decade or so, taking away new players' way of buying various car brands in-game, adding monthly subscriptions for in-game items and currency (which is easily taken away by malicious people) and neglecting the most knowledgeable OG players' suggestions on how to improve the game.

It's sad that the Story Mode, which features a great story and fun characters, is overshadowed by the weight of a neglected, abusive live-service failure."
user_76561198331633598,"in an attempt to save online from cheaters in pc, they've made it unplayable for linux and steam deck users, and have given us a lovely rootkit kernel level spyware that tries to pass off as anticheat

it'll likely be one week at most before modders figure out how to get around it, just as they have for the other games that use battleye

don't bother playing it or buying it right now, if this is what we can expect from them for gta 6, tanking their profit is the only way they'll understand how much disappointment their choices give to the community"

user_76561198147036309,"I enjoyed every single second of this game. But poor support of Linux - that's a total shame for Rockstar developers. I would choose ""mid"" recommendation, but since Steam allows only ""yes"" and ""no"" - FUCK YOU THEN"
user_76561198364209473,"Yeah rockstar you've lost me. I was already tired of having a 120+gb installation when most of this is for online (I only play single player), I was already tired of constantly updating the game with content I'm not going to use, I was already tired of booting and constantly updating that piece of unnecessary trash known as the rockstar launcher when I just want to play the damn game, now you introduce a kernel level anticheat that I need installed to even access single player? Why Rockstar can't split online and story mode into separate installations is beyond me. Kernel level anti cheat is a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Not sure if it was in response to my review, but rockstar has revoked access to the game almost immediately after I posted this review. I get prompted with a message to enter my cd key which is already in use (duh, by me) and I can no longer get past the main menu. Steam support has been no help and neither has rockstar support. 

2nd edit to remove a suggestion that steam probably wouldn't appreciate because I value my account."
user_76561198169847819,"Added support for BattlEye, which means GTA Online no longer works underneath Linux. 

I don't understand why they couldn't have just emailed the BattlEye developers to enable Linux support, because it is a thing with that anti-cheat, but all they said is that you can play the story mode.

If I am assuming correctly, not many people purchasing the game on PC are going to play the story mode (unless they're on steam deck). They mainly want to play the game for GTA Online, which I would also assume that they would like to avoid the cost of a console subscription service like Xbox Live/Gamepass or PSN just to play online.

I have requested a refund, as this game is now just a paperweight in my library after I bought and played it on Linux.


Edit:
Unfortunately I was not able to request a refund due to

[quote=Steam Support] Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum). [/quote]

But yet when Helldivers II added the PSN requirement, they were able to refund the game, regardless of how many hours were played at that time. I personally don't see how this one is any different, especially since I purchased and played the game on Linux and nothing else."
user_76561198271847586,Game now auto bans Linux and steam deck users due to the newly added battle eye anti cheat . Refund the game and stay clear.Online is now unplayable for many users .
user_76561198031932444,"Rockstar just killed off Linux and Steam Deck players like myself with their bogus decision to bring Battle-Eye anticheat into this OVER A DECADE later. you're losing a big part of your recent players and not even fixing the ACTUAL cheater problem, Rockstar can get bent now.🖕"
user_76561198022696711,No longer supports Linux/Steam Deck because they refuse to click a checkbox to enable the support for their new maleware anticheat.
user_76561198254737240,"As much fun as I’ve had with grand theft auto, I can no longer recommend anything that shit star does.

They left verification badges for steam deck on this game for around 2 years, including online features. They let thousands of people buy it under the pretenses that everything functioned on deck.

And then, after we spent our money on it, they added battle eye, and didn’t add deck support to it. Making it completely unplayable for us deck users. Some of us, being parents and all, handhelds like steam deck saved gaming for us.

Rock star took the time to ask valve to run the verifications and get it up on the store page just to pull it out from under so many of us that spent hard earned money on shark cards and such.

So I’d like to kindly say, fuck rock star. And fuck grand theft auto.

I’ll never spend another dime on this garbage ass company. And I’ll never recommend any of their games to anyone. They can go bankrupt. They deserve it.

user_76561198239526072,"Removed the ability to play online on Steamdeck and linux randomly with no forwarning, not a great move. and all the modders and cheaters are back anyway so you've accomplished nothing, great job."
user_76561198176034143,Linux users are now unable to play due to Battleye. Thanks Rockstar! I hope GTA VI flops!
user_76561197973528566,"Game is fantastic, but I can't recommend until they fix two major issues. I do not want to install your trash launcher or your trash anit cheat. We all know Rockstar lets hackers run wild and bans good players. I just want to play single player offline and I still can't without installing all this invasive garbage? What a bunch of ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
user_76561198079843918,"kernel level anticheat is not necessary
  - there are myriad other, better ways to do prevention and detection, rockstar just thinks buying an off-the-shelf ""solution"" is more cost effective than doing it properly
  - requiring such low-level access to your system makes it a greater threat to the playerbase than the presence of cheaters in lobbies (but cheaters are a greater risk to rockstar's profit margins than invading their players' systems)"
user_76561198212055420,"
With the new Anti-cheat system

they lost a part of their users (linux/steam deck)

they made another part of them unhappy (invasive anticheat)

their target (hackers) was unaffected (avoided 23 hours later)

i see no win here

Not good gentlemen
"
user_76561197994533073,"Has become unplayable on Steam Deck and Linux Systems.
They could allow support with the simple tick of a Box. But they won’t even bother.
Shame."
user_76561198057401282,"Imagine adding malware to your game years after launch and cutting off a portion of your players because said malware doesn't work on certain operating systems.

Rockstar is an absolutely pathetic scam of a company and frankly, this type of behavior should result in games being removed from Steam. I bought this game without the extra malware and to have it added after the fact is ridiculous at all, but especially so when it actively results in the removal of peoples ability to play."
user_76561198056165488,"I mainly play on the Steam Deck with my wife on the computer, so thank you for introducing this absolutely useless update that will solve nothing whatsoever at the expense of locking a number of players out of the game. Modders have already figured out how to bypass the anti-cheat, so give yourselves a pat on the back for creating more problems instead of just having proper dedicated servers.

May I also add that Battleye is actually supported on Linux, and Rockstar just simply chooses not to enable it."
user_76561198126704812,Developer has added an Anti-cheat in a 10+ year old game that removes support for Linux.
user_76561199049030124,Not playable on Deck and Linux after BattleEye Integration. Pls fix
user_76561199174068216,"used to work perfectly fine straight of the box on linux and the steam deck and now I can't play online anymore because of the battleye update which isn't even really stopping cheaters.
"
user_76561197979843175,"Recently, and without warning, Rock* decided to drop support for Linux players by updating their anti-cheat software. Valve says it is incredibly easy for the developer to fix, but as usual, this has fallen on deaf ears. Since over 5 million people use a Steam Deck, they've cut off a huge number of people from access to a game they pair for, and without warning."
user_76561198065969874,"I had bought this game solely to play on Steam Deck last year, and it ran perfectly fine until an arbitrary update Rockstar implemented broke online play for Linux users. In a massive show of pettiness, Rockstar also refuses to contact BattlEye to enable us to play online again. The game did need proper anti cheat, but clearly this one doesn't work as modders are still rampant, and the only ones being punished are Linux users. Steam also refuses refund requests despite the issue being 100% Rockstar's fault, so I'm stuck with a game I can no longer play. This whole situation sets a bad precedent for game companies in the future deciding on a whim to take games away from people that paid for them despite them functioning just fine before then."

For all its influence in the open-world genre, GTA V has aged poorly, and most notably in its online portion, that is replete with flaws, showcasing an increasingly obvious cash-grab approach from Rockstar. A breakdown of why this game is such an unbalanced, overly grindy, and frustrating experience to go through is given below.

Incredibly Unbalanced Gameplay
With the development of GTA Online, it has allowed players to progress further in the game with real money spent. Without buying virtual money in-game, it is practically impossible for a new gamer to ever catch up with experienced players, which creates an unfair and discouraging environment for the new or returning player.

Grind Overload
The grind is real and super intense in GTA Online: it takes a lot of hours to get enough in-game money to afford basic stuff or property. This wouldn't be such a huge drawback if it weren't for the painfully repetitive missions and inflated prices.

Inflated Prices

The in-game prices are way too inflated-you have to overgrind them, or invest your real money in them. Essential items, like vehicles and guns, are just too expensive to feel attainable without spending money in real life.

Confusing and Cluttered UI
The UI in GTA Online is needlessly overcomplicated; it is difficult to access or even understand anything from a simple mechanical perspective. It's overboard for the newbies, and it remains a source of frustration for veterans.

Lack of Controller Support
Being a game that originally launched on consoles, it is a puzzling omission. This forces players to use awkward controls, taking away from the immersive experience GTA should offer.

Pay-to-Win Shark Cards
If anything, the addition of Shark Cards has made GTA Online a pay-to-win affair. It is the most irritating feature in competitive multiplayers where spending money on Shark Cards at once gives them a distinct advantage.

Not Enough Tutorials
There are not enough tutorials available; players have been left to figure out advanced-game mechanics themselves. New players get thrown into the deep end, unable to understand basic systems that are not explained to them.

Repetitive Missions
Missions in GTA Online are repetitive, copy-pasted, and offer nothing new. That makes it feel like such a grind that no interesting or variant content is available to the players.

Insufficient Explanation of Key Mechanics
Next to nothing has been explained in this game. How the stock market works, how to set up heists-a lot of things remain underexplained. It ruins the experience for gamers who want to proceed further but have not been provided with the means to understand how.

Boring Gameplay Combined with Prolonged Loading Times

In fact, the gameplay itself becomes a bore at times, and with the in-game loads, it feels just infuriating. Waiting upwards of minutes to start a mission just to face lackluster gameplay is a terrible experience.

Poor AI and Continuous Cheating

The AI is laughably poor and tends to make missions fail by insane and unrealistic behavior. Cheaters and modders still run amok despite anti-cheat implementations, making GTA Online a grand pain in the backside to play for anyone legitimate.

Outdated Jokes and References
This humor that was once edgy now comes off as ultra-datey, such as crypto and NFTs jokes that already feel old. A lack of fresh writing makes this game feel less a breathing, ever-changing online world and more of a relic of the past.

Multiplayer-Only Missions Nobody's Playing
Most missions require multiplayer involvement, yet they are often unpopular or outdated, making the finding of enough players to complete such missions impossible. This is frustrating because solo players are just locked out of content completion.

Recycling of Old Content as ""New""
Rockstar has a trend of recycling old content and passing it as ""new."" That sounds like a lazy and deceptive strategy. Players who would expect new updates are left disappointed with the same old material being passed as something fresh and innovative.

Seasonal Weapons and Other Uninspired Additions
Other attempts at keeping players engaged include seasonal weapons, but these too feel uninspired and don't add any real depth to the gameplay.

GTA V went from revolutionary to frustrating, unbalanced, and outdated. With as many flaws as this, it's tough to recommend GTA Online to anyone looking for a fun, fair, or rewarding game. Save your time, and maybe your money, too."
